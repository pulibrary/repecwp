The randomized  design of the Moving To Opportunity demonstration allows us to compare  groups of youth, initially similar and living in high-poverty public  housing. An 'experimental' group was offered vouchers valid only in a  low-poverty neighborhood; a 'Section 8' group was offered traditional  vouchers without geographic restriction; and a control group was not offered  vouchers.  We study outcomes in four domains: education, risky behavior, mental health, and physical health. Aggregating effect sizes over all of the  outcomes, females in both treatment groups benefited from the moves, while  males in both treatment groups experienced worse outcomes. Females in the  experimental group experienced improvements in education and mental health  and were less likely to engage in risky behaviors. Females in the  traditional voucher group experienced improvements in mental health. Males in both treatment groups were more likely than controls to engage in risky  behaviors and to experience physical health problems. We adopt a  multiple-testing framework to account for the large number of estimates  considered. We show that the overall effects on females in the experimental  group and the effects on mental health for females in both treatment groups  were least likely to be due to sampling variation.

Second, the expected level of terrorism is higher during the  leftist party's tenure in office compared to the one expected during the  rightist party's  term in office. We test the hypotheses above using a newly culled data set  on terrorist attacks in Israel and the occupied territories between 1990 and  2003. The  ?rst hypothesis is strongly supported by the available data obtained from  public opinion polls on the Israeli electorate's intent of voting.

Such methods  can provide only limited insight into male and female poverty separately. Nevertheless, there are  reasons why household resources are linked to the gender composition of the household;  women?s earnings are often lower than men, families in some countries control their fertility  through differential stopping rules, and women live longer than men. It is also possible to link  family expenditure patterns to the gender composition of the household, something we illustrate  using data from India and South Africa. Such a procedure provides useful information on who  gets what, but cannot tell us how total resources are allocated between males and females. More  can be gleaned from data on consumption by individual household members, and for many  goods, collecting such information is good survey practice in any case. Even so, we suspect that  it will be some time before such information can be used routinely to produce estimates of  poverty by gender. A more promising approach is likely to come within a broader definition of  poverty that includes health (and possibly education) as well as income. We discuss recent work  on collecting self-reported measures of non-fatal health, and argue that such measures are already  useful for assessing the relative health status of males and females.

Replications of the  movement?s flagship, the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, have now spread around  the world. While programs aim to bring social and economic benefits to clients,  few attempts have been made to quantify benefits rigorously. This paper draws on  a new cross-sectional survey of nearly 1800 households, some of which are served  by the Grameen Bank and two similar programs, and some of which have no  access to programs. Households that are eligible to borrow and have access to the  programs do not have notably higher consumption levels than control households,  and, for the most part, their children are no more likely to be in school. Men also  tend to work harder, and women less. More favorably, relative to controls,  households eligible for programs have substantially (and significantly) lower  variation in consumption and labor supply across seasons. The most important  potential impacts are thus associated with the reduction of vulnerability, not of  poverty per se. The consumption-smoothing appears to be driven largely by  income-smoothing, not by borrowing and lending.  The evaluation holds lessons for studies of other programs in low-income  countries. While it is common to use fixed effects estimators to control for  unobservable variables correlated with the placement of programs, using fixed  effects estimators can exacerbate biases when, as here, programs target their  programs to specific populations within larger communities.",1998-06,RPDS,morduch_microfinance_poor.pdf,NULL,NULL,"microfinance, project evaluation, Grameen Bank, Bangladesh",0

The correlation between height in  childhood and adulthood is approximately 0.7 for both men and women, so that tall children are  much more likely to become tall adults.

We explore three questions: 1) Do chronic stressors predict physiological  dyregulation? 2) Is that relationship moderated by characteristics of the individual and  social environment? and 3) Do perceived levels of stress mediate the relationship  between stressors and dysregulation?  Methods. Data come from a nationally representative, longitudinal study of older  Taiwanese (n=916). Regression models are used to examine the relationship between  the number of life challenges (i.e., stressors) during 1996-2000 and physiological  dysregulation (in 2000) based on 16 biomarkers that reflect neuroendocrine function,  immune system, cardiovascular function, and metabolic pathways. We include  interaction terms to test whether psychosocial vulnerability moderates the impact of  stressors. Additional models evaluate the mediating effects of perceived stress.  Results. We find a significant association between the number of stressors and  physiological dysregulation only for those with high vulnerability. Even among this  group, the magnitude of the effect is small. The level of perceived stress partly  mediates the relationship between chronic stressors and physiological dysregulation.  Conclusions. Our results provide some support for the theory of allostatic load,  although the relationship between life challenges and physiological dysregulation is  weak. The evidence also supports the stress-buffering hypothesis: the combination of  low social position, weak social networks, and poor coping ability is associated with  increases in the physiological consequences of life challenges.",2007-01,OPR,opr0701.pdf,NULL,NULL,"Chronic stressors, physiological dysregulation, allostatic load, perceived  stress, stressful experiences, Taiwan",0

Methods. Cross-sectional and longitudinal models were used to analyze the relationship between perceived social position and health, as reported by participants in the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study in Taiwan (SEBAS).  Results. Lower perceived social position was associated with declining health three years later. However, the effect was substantially reduced for all health outcomes in the presence of controls for baseline health. Perceived social position remained a significant predictor of depressive symptoms.  Discussion. The findings suggest that the strength of the association between perceived social position and health may have been overstated in cross-sectional studies.

In this context, arts advocates and researchers have made a variety of ambitious claims about how the arts impact communities. These claims, however, are made problematic by the many complications involved in studying the arts. Just consider the possible definitions of the phrase, ?the arts impact communities.? When speaking of ?the arts,? do we refer to individual participation (as audience member or direct involvement?), to the presence of arts organizations (non-profit and for-profit?) or to art/cultural districts, festivals or community arts? When speaking of ?impact,? do we refer to economic, cultural or social impact; do we refer exclusively to direct community-level effects or do we also include individual- and organizational-level ones? By ?communities,? do we mean regions, cities, neighborhoods, schools or ethnic groups?  Of course, there are no authoritative answers to these questions, since different research questions require different definitions. And as one might expect, arts impact studies employ these heterogeneous definitions in a variety of combinations. Given this array of definitions, how would we go about measuring the impact of the arts on communities? One problem is that researchers and arts advocates rarely seem to consider such complications when making claims about the broader impact of the arts, and seldom discuss the implications of making particular theoretical and methodological choices.1  In this paper, I will lay out some of the issues that need to be addressed when thinking about and studying how the arts impact communities, in addition to providing an introduction to the literature on arts impact studies.",2002-06,CACPS,WP20%20-%20Guetzkow.pdf,NULL,Z11,NULL,0

Finally, because the rapidity of organizational as well as technical change means that it is difficult to presume that current patterns of inequality will persist into the future, the authors call on students of digital inequality to study institutional issues in order to understand patterns of inequality as evolving consequences of interactions among firms' strategic choices, consumers' responses, and government policies.",2001-07,CACPS,WP15%20-%20DiMaggio%2BHargittai.pdf,NULL,Z11,"Digital divide, Internet, World Wide Web, computer use, social inequality",0

The issues addressed include support for the role of the classics in education; willingness to alter literature curricula to make room for work by women and people of color; bilingual education in the schools; confidence in the curricular judgment of teachers and professors; the value of modern art; the relative quality of high, popular, and folk culture; and the extent to which the ability to recognize excellence in art is rare or widespread. Analyses belie the notion that Americans' attitudes reflect a ""culture war"" that pits supporters of the classics and high culture against advocates of multiculturalism and cultural diversity. Three separate and largely orthogonal dimensions emerged out of the analyses: support for traditional high culture; support for cultural diversity; and skeptical attitudes towards cultural authority. No tendency was observed for people who support traditional high culture to oppose multicultural reforms (or vice versa). Indeed, educational attainment was strongly associated with support for both.     Analyses also disconfirm arguments that high culture has lost legitimacy or credibility since the 1960s, or that there has been any ""closing of the American mind."" Although support for cultural diversity has grown since the 1960s (in part due to a decline in racism), baby boomers and members of ""Generation X,"" including those who attended college during the 1960s and in later decades, are as likely as their counterparts in previous generations to agree that the classics are important and that there is merit in ""modern art."" In other words, contemporary Americans acknowledge the value of conventionally defined high culture while at the same time discerning value in other cultural forms and often approving of reforms that enhance cultural diversity.",2000-05,CACPS,WP11%20-%20DiMaggio%2BBryson.pdf,NULL,Z11,NULL,0

Most  observers believe that the deregulation of the banking industry and financial markets generally  has played an important part in this transformation. This paper develops and implements a  technique for assessing the impact of changes in the mortgage market on individuals and  households.  Our analysis is based on an implication of the permanent income hypothesis: that the higher a  household?s future income, the more it desires to spend and consume, ceteris paribus. If we  have perfect credit markets, then desired consumption matches actual consumption and current  spending on housing should forecast future income. Since credit market imperfections mute  this effect, we can view the strength of the relationship between housing spending and future  income as a measure of the ?imperfectness? of mortgage markets. Thus, a natural way to  determine whether mortgage market developments have actually helped households by  decreasing market imperfections is to see whether this link has strengthened over time.  We implement this framework using panel data going back to 1969. We find that over the past  several decades, housing markets have become less imperfect in the sense that households are  now more able to buy homes whose values are consistent with their long-term income  prospects.  One issue that has received particular attention is the role that the housing Government  Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have played in improving the  market for housing finance. We find no evidence that the GSEs? activities have contributed to  this phenomenon. This is true whether we look at all homebuyers, or at subsamples of the  population whom we might expect to benefit particularly from GSE activity, such as lowincome  households and first-time homebuyers.",2007-03,CEPS,141rosen.pdf,NULL,"D14, G21, R21",NULL,0

Although economists have longstanding reservations about the feasibility of interpersonal comparisons of utility that we can only partially address here, another question concerns the reliability of such measurements for the same set of individuals over time. Overall  life satisfaction should not change very much from week to week. Likewise, individuals who have similar routines from week to week should experience similar feelings over time.

When the bureaucrats? cost of providing the  public good is their private information, rulers must give them incentive rents to achieve  truthful revelation. Predatory rulers are less willing to part with such rents; therefore  they tolerate more downward distortion in the provision of public goods to reduce the  required rent-sharing. When the bureaucrats? actions are also unobservable, there is a  synergistic interaction between more benevolent rulers and more caring or professional  bureaucrats.

Our empirical results indicate that the vineyards of the Mosel Valley will increase in  value under a scenario of global warming, and perhaps by a considerable amount.

The intention seems to have been to lower expectations of future interest rates.  But the problem in a liquidity trap (when the zero lower bound on the central bank?s instrument  rate is strictly binding) is rather to raise private-sector expectations of the future price level.  Increased expectations of a higher future price level are likely to be much more effective in  reducing the real interest rate and stimulating the economy out of a liquidity trap than a  further reduction of already very low expectations of future interest rates. Therefore, monetarypolicy  alternatives in a liquidity trap should be assessed according to how effective they are  likely to be in affecting private-sector expectations of the future price level. Expectations of  a higher future price level would lead to current depreciation of the currency. Quantitative  easing would induce expectations of a higher price level if it were expected to be permanent.  The absence of a depreciation of the yen and other evidence indicates that the quantitative  easing is not expected to be permanent. In an open economy, the Foolproof Way (consisting  of a price-level target path, currency depreciation and commitment to a currency peg and a  zero interest rate until the price-level target path has been reached) is likely to be the most  effective policy to raise expectations of the future price level, stimulate the economy, and escape  from a liquidity trap. It is the first-best policy to end stagnation and deflation in Japan. The  Foolproof Way without the explicit exchange-rate policy, namely a price-level target path and a  commitment to a zero interest rate until the price-level target path has been reached, would be  a second-best policy. The current policy, a commitment to a zero interest rate until inflation has  become nonnegative is at best a third-best policy, since it accommodates all deflation that has  occurred before inflation turns nonnegative and therefore is not effective in inducing inflation  expectations.",2006-01,CEPS,126svensson.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

Such questions elicit a global evaluation of one?s life.  An alternative method asks people to report their feelings in real time, which yields a measure of  experienced happiness. Surveys in many countries conducted over decades indicate that, on  average, reported global judgments of life satisfaction or happiness have not changed much over  the last four decades, in spite of large increases in real income per capita. While reported life  satisfaction and household income are positively correlated in a cross-section of people at a  given time, increases in income have been found to have mainly a transitory effect on  individuals? reported life satisfaction.

In  this paper we study the effects of school and neighborhood segregation on the relative SAT scores of black  students across different metropolitan areas, using large microdata samples for the 1998-2001 test cohorts.  Without controlling for neighborhood segregation, we find that school segregation is negatively associated  with black relative test scores, and also with relative education and employment outcomes measured in the  2000 Census. In models that include both school and neighborhood segregation, however, the effect of  relative exposure to black schoolmates is uniformly small and statistically insignificant, while  neighborhood segregation has a strong negative effect. Instrumental variables estimates that isolate the  components of school segregation associated with court-ordered desegregation plans or the geographic  features of a city are consistent with this result but imprecise. Models that include school segregation,  neighborhood segregation, and measures of the relative exposure of blacks to other characteristics of their  neighbors (e.g., education and income) show weaker effects of neighborhood segregation, suggesting that  the socio-economic status of neighbors, rather than their race, may be the primary source of these effects.",2005-05,CEPS,109rothstein.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

However, if these income effects are large due to very high discount and interest rates, then labor supply functions could be backward bending, and, in the extreme case where the wage  elasticity of daily labor supply is minus one, drivers could be target earners. Indeed, Camerer, Babcock, Lowenstein, and Thaler (1997) and Chou (2000) find that the daily wage elasticity of labor supply of New York City cab drivers is substantially negative and conclude that it is likely that cab drivers are target earners. I conclude from my empirical analysis, based on new data, of the stopping behavior of New York City cab drivers that, when accounting for earnings opportunities in a reduced form with measures of clock  hours, day of the week, weather, and geographic location, cumulative hours worked on the shift is a primary determinant of the likelihood of stopping work while cumulative income earned on the shift is weakly related, at best, to the likelihood of stopping work.

I use repeated cross-section data from the CPS from 1977-2002 to develop a  measure of the threat as the predicted probability of union membership. I use this measure  to estimate earnings functions that use several sources of variation in the likelihood of  union membership to identify the threat effect in a manner that reduces the likelihood of  omitted variable bias. Finally, I investigate two cases where there has arguably been a  change in the likelihood of union organization that is not correlated with changes in the  demand for labor. These include the wage changes surrounding the introduction of rightto-  work (RTW) laws in two states during the period studied and wage changes surrounding  deregulation of key industries in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The results are mixed. The  preferred estimates from the analysis using predicted probability of unionization as the  threat measure, imply very little relationship between either nonunion wages or the union  wage gap and the threat.

The direction of causation between health status and insurance is similarly unclear.  While a few attempts have been made to implement an instrumental variables (IV) strategy to deal with endogeneity, the instruments chosen have not been entirely convinc-ing. In this paper we revisit the IV estimation of the reduced form relationships between insurance and both health care utilization and health status taking advantage of what we argue is a good instrument ? the individual?s self-employment status. We find that IV estimates of the impact of insurance on the utilization of a variety of health care services are greater than estimates that ignore endogeneity. However, instrumental variables leads to a small and statistically insignificant estimate of the impact of insurance on health status.  The validity of this exercise depends on the extent to which self-employment status is a suitable instrument. To make this case, we analyze panel data on transitions from wage-earning into self-employment and show that individuals who select into self-employment do not differ systematically from those who remain wage-earners with re-spect to either the utilization of health care or health status.

However, a commitment to a simple instrument rule  appears inadequate as a description of current goal-directed and forward-looking monetary policy,  especially inflation targeting. The latter can to a large extent instead be seen as inflation-forecast  targeting, setting the instrument so that the corresponding conditional inflation forecast is  consistent with the inflation target. It is argued, both from a descriptive and a prescriptive  perspective, that inflation targeting is better understood as a commitment to a targeting rule, either  a general targeting rule in the form of clear objectives for monetary policy or a specific targeting  rule in the form of a condition for (the forecasts of) the target variables, essentially the equality of  the marginal rates of transformation and the marginal rates of substitution between the target  variables. Targeting rules allow the use of judgment and extra-model information, are more robust  and easier to verify than optimal instrument rules, and they can nevertheless bring the economy  close to the socially optimal equilibrium. These ideas are illustrated with the help of simple  examples. Some recent defense of commitment to simple instrument rules and criticism of forwardlooking  monetary policy and targeting rules by McCallum, Nelson and Woodford are also  addressed. In the concluding section, robust and optimal rules for monetary policy are suggested.",2002-10,CEPS,84svensson.pdf,NULL,"E42, E52, E58","Inflation targeting, forecast targeting",0
119,Monetary Policy and Real Stabilization,Lars,E.O.,Svensson,"Princeton University, CEPR and NBER",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Monetary policy can achieve average inflation equal to a given inflation target and, at best,  a good compromise between inflation variability and output-gap variability. The complex transmission  mechanism, varying lags and strength of the effects through different channels, unpredictable  shocks and inherent uncertainty prevent any fine-tuning. Monetary policy cannot  completely stabilize either inflation or the output gap. Increased credibility in the form of inflation  expectations anchored on the inflation target will reduce the variability of inflation and  the output gap.  Central banks can improve transparency and accountability by specifying not only an inflation target but also the dislike of output-gap variability relative to inflation variability. This  will better focus the work inside the bank, allow more precise external monitoring and evaluation  of monetary policy, and allow more precise scrutiny and debate about the monetary-policy  objectives.  Central banks can best achieve both the long-run inflation target and the best compromise  between inflation and output-gap stability by engaging in ?forecast targeting,? where at  each major monetary-policy decision, the bank selects the feasible combination of inflation and  output-gap projections that minimize the loss function and the corresponding instrument-rate  plan and sets the instrument-rate accordingly. Announcing and motivating these forecasts maximize  the impact on private-sector expectations and the economy and make the implementation  of policy most effective. This allows the most effective external monitoring and evaluation of the  policy, and thereby creates the strongest incentives for the bank to conduct policy according to  the announced objectives. It also allows precise debate about the monetary-policy objectives.  Forecast targeting implies that the instrument responds to all information that significantly affects  the projections of inflation and the output gap. Therefore it cannot be expressed in terms  of a simple instrument rule, like a Taylor rule.  Financial stability, including a well-functioning payment system, is an important additional objective for the central bank. This objective can conveniently be considered as a restriction on monetary policy that does not bind in normal times, but does bind in times of financial crises.  By producing and publishing Financial Stability Reports with indicators of financial stability,  the central bank can monitor the degree of financial stability and issue warnings to concerned agents and authorities in due time and this way avoid deteriorating financial stability.  Forecast targeting implies that asset-price developments and potential asset-price bubbles are taken into account and responded to the extent that they are deemed to affect the projections of the target variables, inflation and the output gap. In most cases, it will be difficult to make precise judgments, though, especially to identify bubbles with reasonable certainty.  The zero bound, liquidity traps and risks of deflation are serious concerns for a monetary policy aimed at low inflation. Forecast targeting with a symmetric positive inflation target keeps  the risk of the zero bound, liquidity traps and deflation small. Prudent central banks may want  to prepare in advance contingency plans for situations when a series of bad shocks substantially  increases the risk of falling into a liquidity trap, as well as contingency plans escaping from a  liquidity trap. An open economy can use the foolproof way of escaping from a liquidity trap,  with a price level target, a currency depreciation and a temporary exchange rate peg, and an  exit strategy with a shift to inflation target when the price-level target has been reached. This  applies, in particular, to Japan, where not following the foolproof way could imply another lost  decade.",2002-09,CEPS,83svensson.pdf,NULL,"E42, E52, E58","Flexible inflation targeting, output gap stabilization, the foolproof way",0

First, we find that in recent years returns on art assets appear to be little different from returns on other assets.  In addition, some researchers have found that because of the weak correlation between art asset returns with other returns, there may be a case for the inclusion of art assets in a diversified portfolio.  Second, we find evidence of several anomalies in art market pricing.  The evidence clearly suggests that, contrary to the view of the art trade, masterpieces underperform the market.  In addition, there is considerable evidence that there are fairly long periods in which art prices may diverge across geographic areas and even auction houses.  Third, we review the public record of the criminal trial of Sotheby?s former Chairman, who was accused of price fixing, to show the collusion with Christie?s, the other great public auction house, was actually engineered.  Contrary to the way the proceeds from the settlement of the civil suit in this case were distributed, we show that buyers were almost not injured by the collusion, but that sellers were.  In addition, based on the public record of settlement, it appears that the plaintiffs in the civil suit were very handsomely repaid for their injury.  Finally, we review the extensive research on the efforts of the auction institution on price formation.  There is now considerable theoretical research on strategic behavior in auctions, much of it in response to empirical findings, and we review three key findings.  First, the evidence suggests that art experts provide extremely accurate predictions of market prices, but that these predictions do not optimally process the publicly available information.  Second, high reserve prices, and the resulting high unsold (buy-in) rates are best explained as optimal search in the face of stochastic demand.  Third, extensive research has documented that the prices of identical objects are more likely to decline than to increase when multiple units are sold, and this has led to considerable theoretical research.  Subsequent empirical research has tended to document declining demand prices even when the objects are imperfect substitutes.",2002-04,CEPS,81ashenfelter.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

Also, an analysis of internal Firestone engineering tests indicates that P235 tires from Decatur performed less well if they were manufactured during the labor dispute compared with those produced after the dispute, or compared with those from other, non-striking plants.

Using a variety of ways to measure health status, we find that the relative lack of health insurance among the self-employed does not affect their health.  For virtually every subjective and objective measure of health status, the self-employed and wage earners are statistically indistinguishable from each other.

Fourth, I examine how institutions also shape the course of  technology; thus, a world-wide shift in the technology frontier results in different evolutions of production  processes and skill premia across countries with different social contracts. Finally, I ask what joint configurations  of technology, inequality and redistributive policy are feasible in the long run, when all three  are endogenous. I show in particular how the diffusion of technology leads to the ?exporting? of inequality  across borders; and how this, in turn, generates spillovers between social contracts that make it more  difficult for nations to maintain distinct institutions and social structures.",2003-12,WWSEcon,dp226.pdf,NULL,"D31, O33, J3, H10","inequality, welfare state, technical change, skill bias, human capital, redistribution, social  contract, political economy",0

A person generally has only imperfect knowledge of his own ability (or long-term pay) in pursuing a task, and will undertake it only if he has succinct self-confidence. People who interact with him (parent, spouse, friend, teacher, manager, colleague, etc.) often have complementary information about his ability, but also a vested interest in his completing the task. This generates an incentive for such principals to distort their signals so as to manipulate the agent?s self-confidence.  We first study situations where an informed principal chooses an incentive structure, such as offering payments or rewards, delegating a task, or simply giving encouragement. We show that rewards may be weak reinforcers in the short term and that, as stressed by psychologists, they may have hidden costs in that they become negative reinforcers once withdrawn. By offering a low?powered incentive scheme, the principal signals that she trusts the agent. Conversely, rewards (extrinsic motivation) have a limited impact on the agent?s current performance, and reduce his intrinsic motivation to undertake similar tasks in the future. Similarly, empowering the agent is likely to increase his motivation and effort, while offers of help or assistance may create dependence. More generally, we identify under which conditions the hidden costs of rewards are a myth or a reality.  We then consider the fact that people often criticize or downplay the achievements of their spouse, child, colleague, coauthor, subordinate or teammate. We formalize such situations of  ego?bashing, and argue that they may reflect battles for dominance. By lowering the other?s ego, an individual may gain (or regain) real authority within the relationship.  Finally, we turn to the case where it is the agent who has superior information, and may  attempt to signal it through a variety of self?presentation strategies. In particular, people  with low self?esteem often deprecate their own accomplishments in order to obtain leniency (a lowering of expectancies) or a ?helping hand?on various obligations. Such strategies are costly: they are met with disapproval, and may back?re if the desired indulgence is denied.

We build a model of self-confidence where people have imperfect knowledge about their ability, which in most tasks is a complement to effort in determining performance. Higher self-confidence thus enhances motivation, and this creates incentives for the manipulation of self-perception. An individual suffering from time-inconsistency may thus want to enhance the self-confidence of his future selves, so as to limit their procrastination. The benefits of confidence-maintenance must, however, be traded off against the risks of overconfidence (inappropriate tasks being pursued). Moreover, rational inference implies that the individual cannot systematically fool himself. A first application of the model is self-handicapping: to avoid a negative inference about their ability, people may deliberately impair their performance, or choose overambitious tasks. Another application is selective memory or awareness management: people are (endogenously) more likely to remember or consciously acknowledge their successes than their failures. This, in turn, helps explain the widely documented prevalence of self?serving beliefs ?that is, the fact that most people have overoptimistic assessments of their own abilities and other desirable traits. We analyze the workings of this psychological immune system and show that it typically leads to multiple equilibriums in cognitive strategies, self confidence, and behavior. Moreover, while active self-esteem maintenance can improve ex-ante welfare, it can also be self-defeating. Systematically looking on the bright  side, avoiding negative thoughts and people, etc., can thus be beneficial in certain environments; but in other circumstances one can only lose by playing such games with oneself, and it would be better to always accept who you are and be honest with yourself.",1999-12,WWSEcon,dp209.pdf,NULL,"A12, C70, D60, D91, E21, J22","self-confidence, self-esteem, motivation, time-inconsistency, self-control, self-deception,  memory, psychology and economics",0

Regression analyses control directly for some of the most important factors that determine sentences (such as criminal history and offense type) and labor market outcomes (such as education, experience, demographic characteristics, and earnings history).  An instrumental variables approach identifies the causal effect by essentially comparing otherwise similar groups of criminal defendants whose labor market outcomes differ because of the systematically difference sentencing decisions of the judge to whom their case was randomly assigned.  In order to implement these methods, new data were created by linking information about criminal defendants in California federal district court felony cases from 1983-94 with quarterly earnings data collected through the California Unemployment Insurance system from 1987-97.  The results show that incarceration has surprisingly little effect on employment in comparison to those who are not incarcerated, with employment rates only 0-3% lower after 5 to 8 years for those who served prison time.  Further, employment rates for those with longer sentences rebound just as quickly to pre-conviction levels as do those with similar characteristics but shorter sentences.  Negative earnings effects are more pronounced and are concentrated among white-collar criminals, who earn 10-30% less after 5 to 8 years than those who were convicted at the same time but were not incarcerated.

Maternal orphans are significantly less likely to be enrolled in school, and have completed significantly fewer years of schooling, conditional on age, than children whose mothers are alive. Less money is spent on their educations on average, conditional on enrollment. Moreover, children whose mothers have died appear to be at an educational disadvantage when compared to non-orphaned children with whom they live.

Children whose fathers have died live in significantly poorer households, measured on a number of dimensions. However, households in which fathers died were poor prior to fathers? deaths. The death of a father between waves of the survey has no significant effect on subsequent household economic status.

In consequence, measured poverty has fallen less  rapidly than appears warranted by measured growth in poor countries. One plausible cause is that  richer households are less likely to participate in surveys. But growth in the national accounts is  also upwardly biased, and consumption in the national accounts contains large and rapidly  growing items that are not consumed by the poor and not included in surveys.

Re-basing, using updated PPP rates, would be done infrequently. For example, if the global  poverty numbers were estimated annually, the PPP rates might be updated once a decade. In any  case, it is important that the poverty estimates be calculated much more frequently than the PPP  rates are revised. I discuss whether monitoring should be done using national accounts data on  income or consumption, supplemented by distributional data so as to make inferences about  poverty, or from household survey data. I argue that data from the national accounts are not  suitable for measuring poverty and that their use requires assumptions that are unlikely to hold.

We find evidence of a large and causal effect of income on  health status?one that works at least in part through sanitation and living standards, in part  through nutritional status, and in part through the reduction of psychosocial stress. The pension is  used to upgrade household facilities, and some of the improvements made have health  consequences. We find that the household?s water source being on-site and the presence of a flush  toilet are both significantly more likely, the greater the number of years of pension receipt in the  household. In addition, the presence of a pensioner in the household on average reduces the  probability of an adult skipping a meal by 20 percent, and the presence of two pensioners reduces  the probability by 40 percent. All adults in the survey were asked a battery of questions of  depression, which is inextricably linked to stress and health status. We find that, for households  pooling income, the presence of pensioners has a significant effect on reported depression, and  that the effect is larger, the greater the number of pensioners. We conclude that governments  interested in improving health status may find the provision of cash benefits to be one of the most effective policy tools available to them. Cash provides a yardstick against which other health  interventions should be measured.",2001-05,RPDS,case_economic_development_abcde.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

We examine this topic within the framework of the life-cycle hypothesis (LCH).  Life-cycle theory is a natural starting place, since it implies that changes in demographic structure can  exert potentially large effects on national saving: increases in the number of people who save  (presumably those in middle age) relative to those who save little or dissave (the very young and the  elderly) will increase the aggregate saving rate. A related implication of the LCH is that changes in the  rate of growth of per capita income affect saving: higher rates of economic growth increase the life-time  wealth of the young relative to the old, and the effects on saving of higher growth are much the same as  the effects of increasing the numbers of young relative to the old. The LCH also delivers a rich set of  predictions about interactions between economic growth and the age structure. As is emphasized in the  ?variable rate-of-growth? models of Fry and Mason (1982) and Mason (1987, 1988), the effects of  changes in age structure on the saving rate will depend on the life-time wealth of individuals in different  age groups, something determined by economic growth.

The cohort evidence is singularly appropriate for the  analysis of life-cycle models of consumption because, at least in its simpler forms, the life-cycle  hypothesis (LCH) predicts that the cohort average of the logarithm of consumption in any year  can be additively decomposed into a time-invariant cohort effect and an age effect, both of which  can be readily recovered from the cohort data by linear regression on dummy variables. The  results of these cohort level analyses have not been favorable for the LCH interpretation of the  international correlation between growth and saving. According to this, higher rates of economic  growth drive up rates of national saving by expanding the lifetime resources of younger generations,  who are saving, relative to the lifetime resources of older generations, who are dissaving.  While it is typically possible to interpret the cohort results in a way that is consistent with the  LCH, it is a good deal harder to rescue the prediction that higher growth means higher national  saving rates, or at least that the effect is large enough to be consistent with the international  relationship in which a one percentage point increase in the rate of per capita growth is associated  with a roughly two percentage point increase in the saving rate. In Section 1, we review existing  cohort studies from a range of rich and poor countries, and also present new results for Indonesia.  This evidence shows no strong negative relationship between saving rates and age, so that when  higher growth redistributes lifetime resources towards the young, the effect on savings is modest,  and in some cases even negative.",1998-02,RPDS,deaton_paxson_saving_growth.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

In this paper, we offer a  simpler explanation: On average, taller people earn more because they are smarter. As early as  age 3 ? before schooling has had a chance to play a role ? and throughout childhood, taller  children perform significantly better on cognitive tests. The correlation between height in  childhood and adulthood is approximately 0.7 for both men and women, so that tall children are  much more likely to become tall adults. As adults, taller individuals are more likely to select into  higher paying occupations that require more advanced verbal and numerical skills and greater  intelligence, for which they earn handsome returns. Using four data sets from the US and the UK,  we find that the height premium in adult earnings can be explained by childhood scores on  cognitive tests.

Maternal orphans are significantly less likely to be enrolled in school, and have completed significantly fewer years of schooling, conditional on age, than children whose mothers are alive. Less money is spent on their educations on average, conditional on enrollment. Moreover, children whose mothers have died appear to be at an educational disadvantage when compared to non-orphaned children with whom they live.

Although women have lower  mortality than men, they report worse health status up to age 65. The SRHS of both men and  women deteriorates with age. There are strong gradients, so that at age 20, men in the bottom  quartile already report worse health than do men in the top quartile at age 50. In the bottom quartile  of income, SRHS declines more rapidly with age, but only until retirement age. These facts  motivate a study of the role of work, particularly manual work, in health decline with age. The  Grossman capital-stock model of health assumes a technology in which money and time can  effect complete health repair. As a result, declines in health status are driven, not by the rate of  deterioration of the health stock, but by the rate of increase of the rate of deterioration. We argue  that such a technology is implausible, and we show that people in manual occupations have  worse SRHS and more rapidly declining SRHS, even with a comprehensive set of controls for  income and education.

We  reviewed the literature and identified multiple malaria control programmes that  incorporated environmental management as the central feature.

The full package of control measures consisted of vegetation  clearance, modification of river boundaries, draining swamps, oil application to open water  bodies and house screening.

Monthly malaria incidence rates and  vector densities were used for surveillance and adaptive tuning of the environmental  management strategies to achieve a high level of performance.

Whether there is a causal link from income to health, and its size, are important  research issues for those interested in health in developing countries. This paper uses data from an  integrated survey of health and economic well being in South Africa to examine the impact of the  South African old age pension on the health of pensioners, and of the prime aged adults and  children who live with pensioners. We find evidence of a large and causal effect of income on  health status?one that works at least in part through sanitation and living standards, in part  through nutritional status, and in part through the reduction of psychosocial stress. The pension is  used to upgrade household facilities, and some of the improvements made have health  consequences. We find that the household?s water source being on-site and the presence of a flush  toilet are both significantly more likely, the greater the number of years of pension receipt in the  household. In addition, the presence of a pensioner in the household on average reduces the  probability of an adult skipping a meal by 20 percent, and the presence of two pensioners reduces  the probability by 40 percent. All adults in the survey were asked a battery of questions of  depression, which is inextricably linked to stress and health status. We find that, for households  pooling income, the presence of pensioners has a significant effect on reported depression, and  that the effect is larger, the greater the number of pensioners.

Interestingly the effect was similar for white males  and females, but there was no effect for blacks. Continuation school laws, which required working  children to attend school on a part time basis, were effective for white males only. I also find that the  laws increased the education only of those in the lower percentiles of the distribution of education.  This result is consistent with what theory predicts if the laws were indeed enforced. By increasing the  education of the lower tail, the laws contributed to the decrease in educational inequality, perhaps by  as much as 15%. States with more wealth and a higher percentage of immigrants were more likely to  pass more stringent laws, and states with higher percentage of blacks were less likely to do so.

First, it caused  us to refocus our quantitative data collection on a substantially different set of outcomes,  primarily in the domains of safety and health.

Second, our  qualitative work led us to develop an overall conceptual framework for thinking about the  impacts of high-poverty neighborhoods on families and the ways in which moves to lower  poverty neighborhoods might affect these families. We observed that fear of random violence  appears to cause parents in ghetto families to focus a substantial portion of their daily routine on  keeping their children safe. In later quantitative research, we confirmed that parental monitoring  intensity was reduced among families offered housing vouchers. We further hypothesized that  the need to live life on the watch may have broad implications for the future prospects of these  families ? including potential impacts on children?s development and on the mothers? ability to  engage in activities that would lead them to become economically self-sufficient, although  sufficient data to assess this hypothesis are not yet available.

I postulate that individual health is negatively affected by relative  deprivation within a reference group, defined as the ratio to group mean income of the total  ?weight? of incomes of group members better-off than the individual. I argue that such a model is  consistent with what we know about the way in which social status affects health, based on both  animal and human models. The theory has the following predictions. Within reference groups,  which may be as large as whole populations, mortality declines with income, but at a decreasing  rate; the mortality to income relationship is monotone decreasing and convex. If, as is sometimes  observed, the upper tail of the income distribution satisfies Pareto?s Law then, among the rich,  there will be a negative linear relationship between the logarithm of the probability of death and  the logarithm of income, whose slope is larger the larger is Pareto?s constant, itself often  interpreted as a measure of equality. A mean-preserving increase in the spread of incomes raises  the risk of mortality for everyone. Between reference groups, as between states or countries,  mortality is independent of the level of average income, but depends on the gini coefficient of  income inequality, in accord with the actual pattern of aggregate mortality across US states. A  more detailed empirical evaluation, using individual data from the National Longitudinal Mortality  Study, shows that the relative deprivation theory provides a good account of the mortality  gradient within states, but actually fails to account for the pattern between states, and in particular  for the observed positive correlation between mortality and income inequality. Further analysis of  the aggregate data shows that the effect of income inequality is not robust to the inclusion of  other controls, particularly the fraction of blacks in the population. The fraction black is positively  associated with white (male) mortality in both the individual and aggregate data and, once the  fraction black is controlled for, there is no effect of income inequality on either male or female  mortality.

It includes neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and other forms of abuse or neglect.  Using state-level panel data on the numbers of reports and substantiated cases of maltreatment, we  examine whether socioeconomic factors play different roles for these different types of  maltreatment. A key finding is that the economic circumstances of parents matter: increases in the  fractions of children with absent fathers and working mothers are related to increases in many of  the measures of maltreatment, as are increases in the share of families with two non-working  parents, and those with incomes below 75 percent of the poverty line. We also examine the links  between family structure, welfare benefits, and child maltreatment. Welfare programs affect the  incentives of women and men to work and to live in single or dual-parent families. By changing  the family structure and work behavior of parents as well as their incomes, welfare reforms can be  expected to affect the incidence of child maltreatment. Although is too early to accurately  determine what the effects of the recent reforms will be, our analysis indicates that: 1) consistent  with other research, the characteristics of state?s welfare systems have affected the work behavior  and structure of families during the 1977-1996 time period; 2) decreases in a state?s welfare  benefit levels are associated with large increases in child neglect, and with small decreases in  physical abuse.",1999-08,CHWB,paxson_child_maltreat.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

Are economists' standard tools for measuring income inequality  relevant or useful for measuring it? Does income protect health and does income inequality pose  a hazard to health? In this paper, I discuss two different concepts of health inequality and relate  each of them to the literature on inequality in income. I propose a model of reference groups, in  which each individual's health is related to his or her status within the group as measured by  income relative to the group mean. In such a model, increases in income inequality, whether  within groups, or between them, has no effect on average health. Even so, the slope of the  relationship between health and measured income, the ""gradient,"" depends on the ratio of  between to within-group income inequality. The model is extended to allow income inequality to  play a direct positive or negative role in determining health status. Empirical evidence on  cross-country income inequality and life expectancy within the OECD, and on time-series  evidence for the U.S., Britain, and Japan, provide little support for the idea that inequality is a  health hazard at the national level.

We explore three questions: 1) Do chronic stressors predict physiological  dyregulation? 2) Is that relationship moderated by characteristics of the individual and  social environment? and 3) Do perceived levels of stress mediate the relationship  between stressors and dysregulation?  Methods. Data come from a nationally representative, longitudinal study of older  Taiwanese (n=916). Regression models are used to examine the relationship between  the number of life challenges (i.e., stressors) during 1996-2000 and physiological  dysregulation (in 2000) based on 16 biomarkers that reflect neuroendocrine function,  immune system, cardiovascular function, and metabolic pathways. We include  interaction terms to test whether psychosocial vulnerability moderates the impact of  stressors. Additional models evaluate the mediating effects of perceived stress.  Results. We find a significant association between the number of stressors and  physiological dysregulation only for those with high vulnerability. Even among this  group, the magnitude of the effect is small. The level of perceived stress partly  mediates the relationship between chronic stressors and physiological dysregulation.  Conclusions. Our results provide some support for the theory of allostatic load,  although the relationship between life challenges and physiological dysregulation is  weak. The evidence also supports the stress-buffering hypothesis: the combination of  low social position, weak social networks, and poor coping ability is associated with  increases in the physiological consequences of life challenges.",2007-01,OPR,opr0701.pdf,NULL,NULL,"Chronic stressors, physiological dysregulation, allostatic load, perceived  stress, stressful experiences, Taiwan",0

We consider three measures of current health (self-rated health and two measures of physical functioning) and three behavioral indicators (obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption). In urban areas, we find patterns similar to those in industrialized countries: higher SES individuals are more likely to report better health than their lower SES counterparts, regardless of the SES measure considered. In contrast, we find few significant SES-health associations in less urban areas. The results for health behaviors are generally similar between the two areas of residence. One exception is the education-obesity relationship. Our results suggest that education is a protective factor for obesity in urban areas and a risk factor in less urban areas. Contrary to patterns in the industrialized world, income is associated with higher rates of obesity, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption. We also evaluate age and sex differences in the SES-health relationship among older Mexicans.

Prior research indicates that these  ethnic differences in self-reported health (SRH), measured by a simple question asking  individuals to assess their overall health status, persist in the presence of an extensive set of  explanatory variables. In this paper we use data from the first wave of the Los Angeles Family  and Neighborhood Survey (L.A.FANS) to test four hypotheses regarding Hispanic-white  differences in SRH. We evaluate whether poorer health reports among Hispanics result from: (1)  differences in meaning between the Spanish and English versions of the SRH question; (2)  somatization of emotional distress by Hispanics; (3) varying levels of acculturation among  Hispanics; and (4) measures of SES and health that are often omitted in other studies.  Our results provide new insights into the validity of these explanations and suggest avenues for  future research. First, they underscore the importance of language of interview, suggesting that  translation issues between the Spanish and English versions of the SRH question give rise to  some of the differences. Second, although respondents who are depressed are more likely to  report poor SRH, this study provides little evidence to support the somatization hypothesis.  Third, none of our measures of acculturation ? household language, age of immigration, duration  of U.S. residence, and documented status ? is significantly associated with reports of poor health,  although some of the models indicate that foreign-born Hispanics report poorer health than their  native-born counterparts. Finally, whereas controls for health status exacerbate the ethnic  discrepancies in SRH, adjustment for SES ? especially years of schooling ? narrows, but does  not eliminate, the gap.

These findings differ from those in a previous cross-sectional analysis based on the Taiwan study and underscore the importance of using prospective rather than cross-sectional data to examine the effects of DHEAS on health.

We analyzed data from a national survey of 972 middle-aged and elderly respondents in Taiwan including survey, clinical, and biological measures.

The analysis is based on three population-based surveys that include interviews, urine and blood specimens, and physical examinations: The Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study in Taiwan, the Wisconsin Longitudinal Survey, and the MacArthur studies of successful aging. The outcomes comprise six indicators of cardiovascular risk (total/HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin and waist-hip ratio) and four markers of SNS and HPA-axis functioning (epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol and DHEA-S).  US males have significantly (p<0.05) higher risk than females for all indicators of cardiovascular risk except glycosylated hemoglobin. Sex differences are less consistent and smaller in Taiwan. Indicators of SNS and HPA-axis functioning reveal a significant female disadvantage in both countries.

Although Texas is rapidly becoming a majority minority state, the demographic profile of the two public flagships has failed to keep pace with the growth of minority groups among college-age students. Unless qualified minority students who are admitted to the public flagships actually enroll, both institutions will weaken their reach in educating a leadership class for the State?s rapidly growing minority population.  Changes in admissions probabilities during the 1990s reveal substantial changes in the structure of opportunities for African American, white, Hispanic and Asian American applicants. On the one hand, H.B. 588 leveled the playing field for students ranked in the top decile of their class by equalizing their nearly equal odds of admission before the Hopwood decision. This change benefited high achieving minority students who may have been rejected for low test scores or poor essays before the top ten percent law was implemented in 1998. On the other hand, Hopwood reversed the favorable admission probability enjoyed by minority applicants who graduated in the second decile of their class or below, but the non-overlapping groups simulation indicates that no more than three percent of all admitted students were affirmative admits at either institution. The Hopwood reversal benefits white applicants, and especially Asian Americans seeking admission to UT. Moreover, contrary to public criticisms alleging that H.B.588 privileges high performing students who attend low performing schools, the admission probability of students from the major feeder high schools who ranked in the second decile actually rose at both institutions, but most especially at UT.  The ban on affirmative action did have a chilling effect on enrollment odds of minority students admitted to the public flagships. For African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans admitted to A&M, the net odds of enrollment relative to whites, which were well below unity for all groups before Hopwood, fell after 1996. At UT the odds ratios for enrollment conditional on admission, which were below parity before 1996, changed very little for Hispanics and Asian Americans, and dropped slightly for African Americans. Admitted white applicants are significantly more likely to enroll than African Americans and Hispanics granted admission to UT, and Asian Americans accepted to UT after 1997 were about 16 percent more likely to matriculate than their white statistical counterparts. The enrollment analyses forcefully demonstrate that by itself, the top ten percent policy is NOT an alternative to race sensitive admissions; rather, it is a merit-based admission plan that emphasizes high school academic achievement in the admission decision while de-emphasizing standardized achievement tests for top ranked students. In the absence of financial support to needy students coupled with a vigorous outreach program to high schools populated by minority and economically disadvantaged students, the top ten percent policy will not diversify campuses of selective universities.",2003-01,OPR,opr0301.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

The resulting estimates reveal that Guatemalan children  experience high rates of diarrheal and respiratory illness and that these illnesses often involve  multiple symptoms that only partially overlap one another. In addition, estimates from the calendar  demonstrate that the measurement of illness frequency is fairly complex and that classification of  illness into distinct categories may not always be feasible or meaningful. Results regarding  treatment behavior indicate that the vast majority of illnesses are treated and that mothers almost  always receive advice regarding their children?s illnesses from relatives. On the other hand, health  providers are sought for advice and treatment in only about one-third of illnesses. When families  do seek providers, they are more likely to rely on biomedical ones ? especially pharmacists, doctors  and personnel at health posts and centers ? than traditional practitioners.

We show that intergenerational living serves the economic needs of minority and  unmarried female elders more than non-minority and married elders. The greater economic  motivation for co-residence among minority and female elders was suggested both by their  higher reliance on the income of co-resident kin and by their subjective evaluations of who  benefited most from co-residence. However, when the contributions of co-resident kin are  weighed against the additional costs they bring to the household, the inequality-reducing effect  of extension falls considerably. The contributions per co-resident kin are smaller in minority  households, and thus the economic well-being of elders living in extended households is often no  better, and occasionally worse, than had they lived alone. Only unmarried women receive a  substantial net boost from co-residence, primarily because adult offspring who co-reside with  unmarried women contribute more than their counterparts in unmarried male or couple  households.",1998-09,OPR,opr9802.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

Nonetheless, in the past, induced abortion was  considered morally preferable to pregnancy prior to weaning a nursing child. Women then used  medicinal herbs and other organic materials as abortifacients to maintain intervals between births.  More recently, however, shortened periods of postpartum abstinence and reduced child-spacing  appear to be altering the practice of abortion in Zaria. These changes are attributed, in part, to  women's attendance at government and Islamic schools beginning in the late 1970s where they  learned that postpartum abstinence over forty days and that two years of nursing were not  necessary. The appearance of a pregnancy within a year of childbirth is no longer considered to  be disgraceful. Induced abortion now may be less common for married women although a  number of Zaria women reported experiencing spontaneous abortions. Yet if education has led to  a decline in induced abortion among married women, it may be contributing to an increase in  abortion among unmarried secondary school students. Until recently, many Hausa women  married at the ages of 13 or 14, thus precluding the need for abortion. Nowadays, however,  young women seeking secondary education may choose to postpone marriage and childbearing  until they have completed their schooling--often when they are 17 years old, thus increasing the  possibility of premarital pregnancy and abortion. This paper examines these changing patterns of  abortion and child-spacing in relation to women's education, based on research conducted in Zaria from 1994 to 1996.",1997-01,OPR,opr9701.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

Yet there is clear evidence that people employ or give away their scarce resources for other reasons. Motives like moral convictions; compassion; love; a sense of duty such as a duty towards a sick, disabled, or needy relative or other with whom one feels founded solidarity; and principles or beliefs that transcend self-interest and even call for self-sacrifice prompt or contribute to substantial portions of economic and political action that are missing from theories of economic action and from economic sociology. Yet they are morally and culturally important, and they may underlie large societal shifts that shape economic behavior, like the rise of the movements to Make Poverty History and eliminate absolute poverty.

The purpose of this paper is to address that question on the basis of ethnographic evidence collected between 2002 and 2006 in Miami-Dade County. I follow three lines of argument. First, I take stock of earlier works to show how religion and spirituality function as part of a cognitive arsenal that second-generation immigrants deploy to ?make sense? of new and often inhospitable surroundings. In the case of racial minorities this is a matter of critical importance because religious and spiritual narratives can be used to resist and combat normative stereotypes; they can also provide a means for individuals to redefine circumstances in ways that restore dignity, creating a bridge between despair and hope. Even more importantly, adherence to particular religious and spiritual currents can be used by immigrant children to claim new identities in their adopted country.",2006-03,CMD,wp0603.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

Although many scholars think of assimilation as  immigrants joining the new political community or finding a steady job, I argue that in  order to properly conceptualize immigrant assimilation we need to understand the types  of associations immigrants themselves create. Among the types of institutions immigrants  found, religious institutions provide a common meeting place in which they re-create  their culture through shared symbols and rites. The moral authority of religious leaders  encourages trust and solidarity to emerge among immigrants. For these reasons, among  the myriad of possible kinds of associations immigrants can create, religious institutions  help them develop solidarity with a group of peers trying to cross the same mountain en  route toward political and labor market incorporation in their new society.",2005-05,CMD,wp0505.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

By examining the differential  effect of migrant networks on migration propensities of men and women across  destinations, we aim to extend our theoretical understanding of the role of cumulative  causation for influencing migration patterns. Because each destination is defined by  different labor market characteristics related to gender and places of origin are also  marked by different gender relations, we propose and find that there are significantly  different patterns of migration when disaggregating the accumulated migrant experience  by sex, destination, and place of origin (household or village). Using a unique data set  from Thailand that allows us to observe variation across villages, households, and  destinations over time, we observe that migrant characteristics as well as the effect of  prior migration experience change dramatically by destination. Disaggregating migration  experience by destination, we then find that experience in each destination increases the  propensity of migration to that destination significantly. However, the magnitude of this  increase is different in each destination. Further disaggregating migration experience by  sex, we find that in all destinations, female migration experience has a stronger effect  than male migration experience at each level of observation (individual, household or  village) upon the probability of migration. Finally, modeling men?s and women?s  migration separately, we find that the effect of migration experience also depends on  whether the migrant is a man or woman.",2005-05,CMD,wp0504.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

This incongruous finding has been tied both to levels of acculturation and Spanish-language use, questioning the validity of self-reported health for Spanish speakers in the United States. Furthermore, in the same way that Hispanic adults interviewed in Spanish have worse self-rated health, when asked in Spanish mothers rate their children?s health as worse than those mothers who answer in English. The exact reasons for this relationship, though, are unclear. Frequently this language effect has been taken as an indicator of acculturation; as such, the assumption is that as time progresses Hispanics become more acculturated and answer questions regarding their health more similarly to non-Hispanic whites.  However, up until this point there has been no longitudinal research examining the relationship between rated health and language of interview. Using three waves of data on Hispanic mothers and their children from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study, this paper addresses the following questions: 1. Is Spanish language interview predictive of worse rated health for both mothers and children, and do these relationships change over time? 2. Does the effect of language on rated health persist after controlling for potential mediators? By employing two-level generalized linear models, we find that on average, those who were interviewed in Spanish are more likely to rate their and their children?s health as worse than those who answered in English. The effect of language of interview on reported health persists over time, even after controlling for measures of acculturation, physical and mental health, and access to health care. Contrary to what some have proposed, we see no discernable change over time in the way women rate their own health or that of their children.",2007-05,CRCW,WP07-13-FF.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

Welfare program  participation and state welfare generosity are positively associated with the likelihood of  choosing abortion. The existence and magnitude of this relationship, however, is mediated by the  rules of state welfare bureaucracies and also varies by women?s race and marital status.

In particular, they worry that by providing mothers with an income that is independent of marriage, welfare and child support policies may discourage marriage and increase union dissolution. Economic theory is clear with respect to the marriage disincentives of welfare for single mothers (Becker 1981), but it is ambiguous with respect to child support. Whereas stronger enforcement reduces the costs of single motherhood for women, making marriage less attractive, it increases the costs for fathers, making marriage more attractive. Which effect dominates is an empirical question. Although empirical studies vary with respect to effect size and methods, the evidence compiled during the 1980s and early 1990s indicates that welfare generosity during this period had a small negative effect on marriage among mothers (Moffitt 1998) whereas strong child support enforcement reduced single motherhood by reducing nonmarital childbearing.",2007-03,CRCW,WP07-10-FF.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

Fathers? recent and past incarceration is found to be strongly and negatively associated with the frequency of contact among non-Latino White fathers, while having little to no effect on contact for African American and Latino fathers. As African American and Latino families have been disproportionately affected by policies associated with mass incarceration, we speculate that they may attach less stigma to fathers? incarceration than White families, perceive the criminal justice system as unjust, or exhibit greater resilience.

A simple  economic bargaining model predicts that living in a state with stricter child support enforcement  increases the bargaining power of married mothers, who can more credibly threaten divorce.  The effect on cohabiting mothers is less clear because enforcement increases a father?s incentive  to marry, which potentially increases his bargaining power within a cohabiting union. Using the  Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we find evidence that living in a state with stricter  child support enforcement increases the bargaining power of married mothers, but reduces the  bargaining power of cohabiting mothers. Furthermore, among mothers who were cohabiting at  birth, only those who marry the father after the birth are better off in stricter states.

We examine these approaches by refining and  expanding previous work on a generalized logit model of the mothers? actual family  formation outcomes, in a hierarchy that includes father absence, father involvement,  cohabitation, and marriage. Refinements involve measurements of family formation that  make our results more comparable to other studies and new controls for previous fertility  with the father of the focal child and with another partner (multiple partner fertility). We  estimate these models using interim data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being  12 month follow-up Survey. The results indicate that, unlike their effects on mature  families, cash benefits increase the odds of family formation (short of marriage) among  fragile families and effective child support enforcement increases the odds of marriage.  However, the father?s employment status outweighs the effects of these traditional  income security policies on family formation, because it affects outcomes all along the  hierarchy, including marriage, and its effects are larger. Unlike previous research, our  data on previous fertility enables us to separate the effects of previous children in  common from multiple partner fertility on family formation. Both significantly affect  family formation (though in opposite directions), but even after including these variables,  blacks, who are more likely to bring children from previous unions into a new union,  have substantially lower odds of cohabitation and marriage than non-Hispanic whites.",2002-02,CRCW,WP02-02-FF-Mincy.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

How do unmarried parents differ among themselves on these domains? How important are marriage expectations in differentiating unmarried parents? And to what extent do differences in demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status explain differences in attitudes and relationship quality?  The results suggest that expectations of marriage are a key indicator of a couple?s marriage potential. Comparing married parents to unmarried parents, based on their living arrangement alone, provides incomplete information regarding the differences in human capital, attitudes, and relationship quality. Cohabitors and visitors are quite similar on most domains. However, mothers with high expectations of marriage have attitudes more favorable for marriage and better relationship quality than do mothers with low marriage intentions, even after controlling for their higher human capital.

In accordance with expectations, we find that a significant proportion of unmarried fathers report participation in the underground. However, although the theoretical model predicts a positive relationship between the tax rate and underground hours of work (under certain conditions), we find that the effect of the tax rate on hours is statistically indistinguishable from zero, even after including exogenous variation in tax rates. We also fail to find a positive and statistically significant effect of the tax rate on participation in the underground. Within the context of the model, these results have specific implications for the magnitudes of the probability of detection and the penalty on evaded tax.

First, it is shown that results of quantitative summaries of the literature, such as Hanushek, depend critically on whether studies are accorded equal weight.  Huanushek summarizes 277 estimates extracted from 59 published studies, and weights all estimates equally, which implicitly places more weight on some studies than others.  A small number of studies, which often present estimates for several small subsamples of a larger sample, account for more than half of the estimates.  Studies from which relatively many estimates were extracted tend to find negative effects of school resources, whereas the majority of studies from which relatively few estimates were extracted tend to find positive effects.  When all studies in Hanushek's literature summary are given equal weight, resources are systematically related to student achievement.  In addition, when studies are assigned weights in proportion to the impact factor of the journal in which they were published - a crude measure of journal quality - class size is systematically related to achievement.  When studies are given weights in proportion to their number of estimates, however, resources and achievement are not systematically related.  It is argued that assigning equal weights to studies, or weights according to quality, is preferable to assigning weights according to the number of estimates extracted from the studies, because study quality is unlikely to be related to the number of estimates taken from the study, and because researcher discretion in selecting estimates is limited when studies are assigned equal weight.  Second, a cost-benefit analysis of class size reduction is performed.

Street children, who are among the most severely  disadvantaged children of any society, are the particular focus of this paper. The 1989 UN  Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) constitutes a bold new approach to children?s  rights, requiring governments to assume new commitments to helping street children. Latin  America has a particularly strong history of work with street children, spanning at least 30 years,  but governments have not managed to guarantee access by street children to their basic human  rights. This paper explores CRC adherence with respect to street children in two Latin American  countries ? Mexico, a fairly affluent country and Ecuador, a relatively poor one. I divide my  exploration of each country?s observance of the CRC into the broad fields of legislation,  implementation and enforcement, and assess governmental progress in the decade since their  ratification of the Convention. Findings are disappointing for both countries: they suggest that  domestic legislation is still inadequate, and that neither government has implemented the  policies or allocated the budgetary resources necessary to ensure that street children gain  access to their rights. Regrettably, data collection, monitoring of implementation and  measurement of outcomes, are all gravely inadequate for enforcement of CRC provisions in  Mexico and Ecuador. The findings suggest that strong monitoring and enforcement  mechanisms are required to counter existing disincentives for governments to invest in street  children. Substantial improvements are needed, particularly in the field of enforcement, before  street children in Mexico and Ecuador can gain consistent access to their basic human rights.  The prospects for Ecuador?s street children are particularly bleak: the government will need  considerable international support to be able to deliver on its commitments to street children  under the CRC.

Similarly, Lisbet Palme claimed, after travelling to some of the worst conflict zones in Africa, that, For many of the  children I have met and talked with, the Convention takes on a very meaningful reality.  Yet, during the 1990?s, more children in Africa became victims of, and combatants in, war than at any time in history. Partially as a result, a bitter Human Rights Watch Report assessing the state of children?s rights ten years  after the Convention on the Rights of Children came into force was entitled Promises Broken.  Indeed, to enhance further international humanitarian law protecting children during war, governments agreed in January 2000, after six years of negotiations, to an Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of  the Child that raises the minimum age of combatants to eighteen.",2000-05,CRCW,WP00-02-Herbst.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

Street children, who are among the most severely  disadvantaged children of any society, are the particular focus of this paper. The 1989 UN  Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) constitutes a bold new approach to children?s  rights, requiring governments to assume new commitments to helping street children. Latin  America has a particularly strong history of work with street children, spanning at least 30 years,  but governments have not managed to guarantee access by street children to their basic human  rights. This paper explores CRC adherence with respect to street children in two Latin American  countries ? Mexico, a fairly affluent country and Ecuador, a relatively poor one. I divide my  exploration of each country?s observance of the CRC into the broad fields of legislation,  implementation and enforcement, and assess governmental progress in the decade since their  ratification of the Convention. Findings are disappointing for both countries: they suggest that  domestic legislation is still inadequate, and that neither government has implemented the  policies or allocated the budgetary resources necessary to ensure that street children gain  access to their rights. Regrettably, data collection, monitoring of implementation and  measurement of outcomes, are all gravely inadequate for enforcement of CRC provisions in  Mexico and Ecuador. The findings suggest that strong monitoring and enforcement  mechanisms are required to counter existing disincentives for governments to invest in street  children. Substantial improvements are needed, particularly in the field of enforcement, before  street children in Mexico and Ecuador can gain consistent access to their basic human rights.  The prospects for Ecuador?s street children are particularly bleak: the government will need  considerable international support to be able to deliver on its commitments to street children  under the CRC. Mexico has a more developed political economy and has made more progress  than Ecuador; the Mexican government is in a position to make substantial advances toward  guaranteeing street children their rights as provided by the CRC.",2000-02,CRCW,WP00-01-DeBenitez.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

Our data consist of vital records that have been linked to hospital discharge records and Medicaid claims for all births to women in New Jersey in the years 1989 and 1990.

We limit our analysis to low-income women as this is the population most at risk of an adverse birth outcome and the target of Medicaid.  The results indicate that Medicaid has a small effect on the incidence of low-birth  weight for black women, but has little effect on average birth weight for low-income women.  Our preferred estimates suggest that Medicaid participation reduces the incidence of low-birth weight for black women by between 5 and 10 percent.

995,Adaptation of Immigrant Children to the United States: A Review of the Literature,Kristin,NULL,McCarthy,Columbia University,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Over the last several years, as new waves of immigrants have continued to enter the United  States, the effects of immigration on the nation?s economy and society have been hotly debated.  Largely ignored in the debate, however, has been the wellbeing of immigrant children. Little is  known about the adaptation process that these children must navigate, or the unique health, educational,  and psychosocial consequences that emerge as they learn a new culture, new community, and often, a  new language.  Recent research confirms that immigration results in enormous stress for children. The stress  may come from leaving a familiar social context and extended family network, from entering a new  place, culture, and language, or from harsh conditions endured before or during the transitional journey.  Many immigrant children struggle to establish and re-establish themselves in the United States ?  redefining their roles within the family as well as their relationship to a new society ? without the support  of the strong kinship or friendship systems they had at home, and often without the fulfillment of their  basic needs.  For adolescent immigrants, the stress can be even more intense. Intergenerational conflict can  weigh heaviest on adolescents when parents begin to notice their children?s quicker acculturation and to  resent what they perceive as a rejection of the family?s own ethnic culture. These adolescents have to  balance two different worlds and move fluidly between them. Experts agree that being connected and  accepted is an important component of adolescent development. Children who do not connect in some  meaningful way with their peers, family, or school are at an increased risk of suicide, substance abuse,  school failure and drop-out, health problems, and criminal activity. In some cases, the added pressures  of the acculturation process may exacerbate these risks. In particular, immigrant children may be alienated from school and rejected by their native-born peers because of their lack of fluency in English  or their different cultural practices.  Research has typically focused on the ?problems? and ?maladaptive behaviors? of immigrant  children. This negative orientation contributes to the idea that individual children are to be blamed for  their poor adjustment or performance and often ignores the impact of institutional racism, or more  broadly, the particular socioeconomic, political, and historical contexts of the host and receiving  countries. In addition to these external factors, the negative approach also tends to overlook the crucial  role of ethnic peer groups, social networks, and parent-child relationships in the process of adjusting to  a new environment while maintaining traditional values and beliefs.  Recent studies have demonstrated that a ?positivist? approach to immigration and acculturation  yields important information about not only the risks but also the strengths that result from the  immigration experience. For example, bicultural competence ? the ability to function successfully in  both family (?traditional?) and school (?mainstream?) cultures ? can emerge as a result of immigrant  children?s conflict.  While it gives reason for optimism, the research is also clear that immigrant children have unique  needs, and that schools should address these needs proactively. Many immigrant students appear to  overcome their obstacles and excel academically. But what is the toll on their mental health? How are  they adapting psychosocially? Often, seemingly competent students are left to manage the mental and  emotional stress alone, with serious consequences for their later quality of life. Other immigrant students  find the obstacles too difficult to overcome. How can struggling students be better supported so that  they are both better able to learn and to adapt in the long-term?  Schools, where mainstream cultural norms and values are introduced and reinforced, are often  the context in which the adaptation and acculturation processes occur. While efforts have been made in  the last several years to improve English acquisition and educational outcomes among immigrant  children, these initiatives have only scratched the surface; they have not comprehensively supported  these children as they undergo not only the usual stresses of childhood, but also the additional burden of  major family transition and life change as a result of immigration.  The literature suggests the need to explore individual, group, and external forces at work in the  families, communities, and schools where immigrant children are finding their places and building the  foundation for their futures. Efforts to design appropriate, efficient, and effective interventions to  support immigrant children will depend upon a comprehensive theoretical and practical understanding of  the challenges facing immigrant children, as well as careful analysis of the practices and policies that have  been implemented to date.",1998-01,CRCW,WP98-03-McCarthy.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

We find that girls devote more time to household tasks  than boys with this gender gap increasing across high school. Teens? efforts are greater in larger  families, especially for girls, and those headed by single or remarried parents. Lastly, high  school males spend more time on extra-curricular and leisure activities than girls who work  longer hours in both unpaid and paid labor.

I analyze the data on life satisfaction (happiness) and on health satisfaction and look at their relationships with national income, age, and life-expectancy. Average happiness is strongly related to per capita national income; each doubling of income is associated with a near one point increase in life satisfaction on a scale from 0 to 10. Unlike most previous findings, the effect holds across the range of international incomes; if anything, it is slightly stronger among rich countries. Conditional on national income, recent economic growth makes people unhappier, improvements in life-expectancy make them happier, but life-expectancy itself has little effect. Age has an internationally inconsistent relationship with happiness. National income moderates the effects of aging on self-reported health, and the decline in health satisfaction and rise in disability with age are much stronger in poor countries than in rich countries. In line with earlier findings, people in much of Eastern Europe and in the countries of the former Soviet Union are particularly unhappy and particularly dissatisfied with their health, and older people in those countries are much less satisfied with their lives and with their health than are younger people. HIV prevalence in Africa has little effect on Africans? life or health satisfaction; the fraction of Kenyans who are satisfied with their personal health is the same as the fraction of Britons and higher than the fraction of Americans. The US ranks 81st out of 115 countries in the fraction of people who have confidence in their healthcare system, and has a lower score than countries such as India, Iran, Malawi, or Sierra Leone. While the strong relationship between life-satisfaction and income gives some credence to the measures, as do the low levels of life and health satisfaction in Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union, the lack of correlations between life and health satisfaction and health measures shows that happiness (or self-reported health) measures cannot be regarded as useful summary indicators of human welfare in international comparisons.",2007-08,RPPE,Deaton_Aging_and_wellbeing_around_the_world_Aug_07_ALL.pdf,NULL,NULL,"Gallup World Poll, Happiness, Life-satisfaction, Health, Income, Aging, HIV, Healthcare",0

In particular, we examine whether gender peer effects work through changes in classroom learning and social environment, teaching methods and pedagogy, and teacher burnout and work satisfaction. In assessing these mechanisms, we distinguish between the effects generated by changes in the classroom gender composition and those generated by changes in the behavior of students. To control for potentially confounding unobserved characteristics of schools and students that might be correlated with peer gender composition, we rely on idiosyncratic variations in gender composition across adjacent cohorts within the same schools. Our results suggest that an increase in the proportion of girls leads to a significant improvement in students? cognitive outcomes. The estimated effects are of similar magnitude for boys and girls. As important mechanisms, we find that a higher proportion of female peers lowers the level of classroom disruption and violence, improves inter-student and student-teacher relationships as well as students? overall satisfaction in school, and lessens teachers? fatigue. We find, however, no effect on individual behavior of boys or girls, which suggests that the positive peer effects of girls on classroom environment are due mostly to compositional change, namely due to having more girls in the classroom and not due to improved behavior of peers.",2007-07,ERS,23.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

Women  who were nutritionally deprived as children are significantly more likely to be obese as adults, while  men who were deprived as children face no greater risk. In addition, women of higher adult socioeconomic  status are significantly more likely to be obese, which is not true for men. These two factors can fully  explain the difference in obesity rates we find in our sample.

Over the five years from 1999?2000 to 2004?05, the food component of  the CPIAL understated the rate of food price inflation. This overstatement is likely  attributable to the use of long outdated weights (from 1983), and the resultant overweighting  of cereals, particularly coarse cereals, whose prices fell relative to other foods.  The overall weight of food in the CPIAL is also too large, so that the growth in the  general CPIAL was understated during this period when food prices fell relative to  nonfood prices. Under conservative assumptions, I calculate that the 5 year growth in the  reported CPIAL of 10.6 percent should have been 14.3 percent. Indian poverty lines are  held constant in real terms and are updated using the food and non-food components of  the official indices weighted by the food shares of households near the poverty line.  Because these weights come from a 1973?4 survey, food is heavily over weighted for the  contemporary poor, and the nominal poverty lines are understated, both because the  CPIAL food index is understated, and because too much weight is assigned to food in a  period when food prices have been falling relative to nonfood prices. As a result, and  ignoring other problems with the counts (doubtful interstate and intersectoral price  indexes and the growing discrepancy between surveys and national accounts), the official  poverty counts for rural India in 2004?5 are too low; the official headcount ratio of 28.3  percent should be closer to 31 percent; at current rates of rural poverty reduction, this  eliminates more than three years of progress. More generally, it is clear that the weights  used for price indexes should be updated more frequently than is presently the case,  something that could be straightforwardly done using India?s regular system of household  expenditure surveys.",2008-01,RPDS,deaton_price_trends_in_India_version_3_Jan_08_ALL.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

Pension receipt also influences where this employment takes place. We find large, significant effects on labor migration upon pension arrival.

This analysis draws on baseline data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a 20-city study of unmarried parents and their children, to examine the relationship between pregnancy intentions and early parental and child outcomes. The study takes advantage of data collected from fathers and mothers to look at an alternate measure of pregnancy intention whether either parent considered abortion at the time they learned of the pregnancy and whether it is associated with maternal and paternal behaviors during the pregnancy and with infant birth weight.  Results from regression analyses show that mothers are less likely to initiate early prenatal care and fathers are less likely to make cash or in-kind contributions during the pregnancy when one or both parents considered abortion. Which parents? intentions are influential varies by outcome as well as by which parent reported it. Having both parents or the mother only consider abortion is also negatively associated with mothers? reports of all parental behaviors, while having both parents or the father only consider abortion is negatively associated with fathers? reports of their in-kind contributions and both parents? reports of fathers? cash contributions. Parents? considerations are not significantly associated with infant birth weight.  For early initiation of prenatal care, mothers? reports of having considered abortion are consequential but fathers? reports are not. Fathers? considerations matter for their reports of their own contributions, but these outcomes are even worse when both parents considered abortion.

In addition, women of higher adult socioeconomic  status are significantly more likely to be obese, which is not true for men.

Nondemocratic regimes need the use of force in order to  remain in power, but this creates a political moral hazard problem; a strong military may not  simply work as an agent of the elite but may turn against them in order to create a regime  more in line with their own objectives. The political moral hazard problem increases the cost  of using repression in nondemocratic regimes and in particular, necessitates high wages and  policy concessions to the military. When these concessions are not su� cient, the military  can take action against a nondemocratic regime in order to create its own dictatorship. A  more important consequence of the presence of a strong military is that once transition to  democracy takes place, the military poses a coup threat against the nascent democratic regime  until it is reformed. The anticipation that the military will be reformed in the future acts as  an additional motivation for the military to undertake coups against democratic governments.  We show that greater inequality makes the use of the military in nondemocratic regimes more  likely and also makes it more di� cult for democracies to prevent military coups. In addition,  greater inequality also makes it more likely that nondemocratic regimes are unable to solve  the political moral hazard problem and thus creates another channel for the emergence of  military dictatorships. We also show that greater natural resource rents make military coups  against democracies more likely, but have ambiguous e�ects on the political equilibrium in  nondemocracies (because with abundant natural resources, repression becomes more valuable  to the elite, but also more expensive to maintain because of the more severe political moral  hazard problem that natural resources induce).

The need to provide such incentives, implies that an oligarchy adopting a mass-army  may voluntarily decide to promise some amount of income redistribution to its citizens, con-  ditionally on satisfactory performance as soldiers. When the elite cannot credibly commit to  provide an incentive-compatible redistribution, they may cope with the moral hazard problem  of the citizens-soldiers only by relinquishing political power to them through the extension of  franchise. This is because democracy always implements a highly redistributive ?scal policy,  which makes ?ghting hard incentive-compatible for the citizens-soldiers. We show that a tran-  sition to democracy is more likely to occur when the external threat faced by an incumbent  oligarchy is in some sense intermediate.

So when I subsequently delivered the Robbins Lectures at the London School of Economics the following year, this is what I concluded on the subject:  My own hunch is that, on balance, the additional monetary policy inertia imparted by group decisionmaking provides a net benefit to society.  But my main point is simpler: My experience as a member of the FOMC left me with a strong feeling that the theoretical fiction that monetary policy is made by a single individual maximizing a well-defined preference function misses something important.

National Time Accounting is a set of methods for measuring, comparing and analyzing how people spend and experience their time -- across countries, over historical time, or between groups of people within a country at a given time. The approach is based on evaluated time use, or the flow of emotional experience during daily activities. After reviewing evidence on the validity of subjective well-being measures, we present and evaluate diary-based survey techniques designed to measure individuals? emotional experiences and time use. We illustrate NTA with: (1) a new cross-sectional survey on time use and emotional experience for a representative sample of 4,000 Americans; (2) historical data on the amount of time devoted to various activities in the United States since 1965; and (3) a comparison of time use and well-being in the United States and France. In our applications, we focus mainly on the U-index, a measure of the percentage of time that people spend in an unpleasant state, defined as an instance in which the most intense emotion is a negative one. The U-index helps to overcome some of the limitations of interpersonal comparisons of subjective well-being. National Time Accounting strikes us as a fertile area for future research because of advances in subjective measurement and because time use data are now regularly collected in many countries.",2007-11,CEPS,157krueger.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

I develop falsification tests based on the assumption that teachers in later  grades cannot have causal effects on students? test scores in earlier grades. A simple VAM like those  used in the literature fails this test: 5th grade teachers have nearly as large effects on 4th grade gains as  on 5th grade gains. This is direct evidence of non-random assignment. I use a correlated random  effects model to generalize the test to more complex estimators that allow for tracking on the basis  of students? permanent ability. The identifying restrictions of these estimators are again rejected.  Teacher assignments evidently respond dynamically to year-to-year fluctuations in students?  achievement. I propose models of this process that permit identification. Estimated teacher effects  are quite sensitive to model specification; estimators that are consistent in the presence of (some  forms of) dynamic tracking yield very different assessments of teacher quality than those obtained  from common VAMs. VAMs need further development and validation before they can support  causal interpretations or policy applications.,2007-11,CEPS,159rothstein.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

While the use of a binary treatment indicator is attractive for ease of interpretation and  estimation, it treats all exposure the same. The extent of exposure to the treatment, however, is  potentially important in determining the outcome; particularly in training programs where a main  feature is the varying length of the training spells of participating individuals. In this paper, we  illustrate how recently developed methods for the estimation of causal effects from continuous  treatments can be used to learn about the consequences of heterogeneous lengths of enrollment in  the evaluation of training programs. We apply these methods to data on Job Corps (JC),  America?s largest and most comprehensive job training program for disadvantaged youth. The  length of exposure is a significant source of heterogeneity in these data: while the average  participation spell in JC is 28 weeks, its standard deviation and interdecile range are 27 and 62  weeks, respectively. We estimate average causal effects of different lengths of exposure to JC  using the ?generalized propensity score? under the assumption that the length of the individual?s  JC spell is randomly assigned, conditional on a rich set of covariates. Finally, using this  approach, we document important differences across different spell lengths and across three  racial and ethnic groups of participants (blacks, whites and Hispanics) that help understand why  the benefits these groups receive from JC are so disparate from estimates derived using  traditional methods.",2007-06,IRS,dsp01n583xt970,NULL,"C21, J24, I38","Training Programs, Continuous Treatments, Generalized Propensity Score, Dose-  Response Function",0

Football and basketball records generally have small and statistically insignificant effects; in some specifications, a winning basketball season reduces do-nations. For women there is no statistically discernible effect of a former team?s success on cur-rent giving; as is the case for men, the impacts of football and basketball, while statistically sig-nificant in some specifications, are not important in magnitude.

Another  is that there has been an increase in rates of job change that is not captured in the limited  questions asked in the DWS. Some of this seemingly voluntary job change (e.g., the taking  of an offered buy-out) may reflect the kind of worker displacement that the DWS was  meant to capture but is not reported as such by workers.  In this study, I address these issues by 1) documenting the decline in job tenure and longterm  employment using data from various supplements to the Current Population Survey  (CPS) from 1973-2006, 2) documenting the lack of secular change in rates of job loss  using data from the DWS from 1984-2006, and 3) exploring the extent to which the  observed patterns result from a relative increase in rates of job loss among high-tenure  workers. I find that the decline in job tenure and long-term employment is restricted to the  private sector and that there has been some increase in job tenure and long-term  employment in the public sector. I find no secular changes in relative rates of job loss in  either sector that could account for these trends. Reconciliation of the trends in the tenure  and displacement data must lie with a failure to identify all relevant displacement in the  DWS.",2008-06,CEPS,171farber.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

We test the iron law using observational data on alumni giving at an anonymous research university, which we refer to as Anon U. At Anon U, volunteers use lists provided by the Devel-opment Office to telephone classmates and solicit them for donations. The names on these lists are always in alphabetical order. The volunteers who do the soliciting often run out of time be-fore they reach the end of their lists, and conditional on reaching the end of their lists, the solici-tations are likely to be done with less energy and enthusiasm. These observations suggest a sim-ple strategy for testing whether solicitation matters, viz., examine whether alumni with names toward the end of the alphabet are less likely to give than alumni with names toward the begin-ning, ceteris paribus. If so, then solicitation matters.  Our main finding is that location in the alphabet--and hence, solicitation-- has a strong ef-fect on probability of making a gift, but not on the amount given, conditional on donating. This result is consistent with a theoretical model of charitable behavior developed by Andreoni and Payne [2003], in which solicitation reduces the transaction cost of making a gift. Our finding is also in line with a model in which individuals donate to charities in order to avoid the solicitor?s disapproval. In this case, the donation per se is perceived as eliminating the stigma; the amount given, conditional on giving, has no additional impact. We also find that women respond more strongly to solicitation than men. This is consistent with a robust result in the psychology litera-ture, that women find it more difficult than men to refuse requests that they perceive as being legitimate.",2008-08,CEPS,173rosen.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

National Time Accounting is a set of methods for  measuring, comparing and analyzing how people spend and experience their time --  across countries, over historical time, or between groups of people within a country at a  given time. The approach is based on evaluated time use, or the flow of emotional  experience during daily activities. After reviewing evidence on the validity of subjective  well-being measures, we present and evaluate diary-based survey techniques designed to  measure individuals? emotional experiences and time use. We illustrate NTA with: (1) a  new cross-sectional survey on time use and emotional experience for a representative  sample of 4,000 Americans; (2) historical data on the amount of time devoted to various  activities in the United States since 1965; and (3) a comparison of time use and wellbeing  in the United States and France. In our applications, we focus mainly on the Uindex,  a measure of the percentage of time that people spend in an unpleasant state,  defined as an instance in which the most intense emotion is a negative one. The U-index  helps to overcome some of the limitations of interpersonal comparisons of subjective  well-being.

Given the high rates of fatherhood among men in jails and prisons, a large number of children are  placed at considerable risk when a parent is incarcerated. This paper examines one dimension of the  economic risk faced by children of incarcerated fathers: the reduction in the financial support that  they receive. We use a population-based sample of urban children to examine the effects of  incarceration on this support. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal regression models, as well as a  propensity score matching analysis, indicate that men with incarceration histories are significantly  less likely to contribute to their families and those that do contribute provide significantly less.  Moreover, sensitivity analysis suggests that these differences are unlikely to be a result of unobserved  heterogeneity between incarcerated and never-incarcerated fathers. The negative effects of  incarceration on fathers? financial support are due not only to diminished performance in the labor  market by formerly incarcerated men, but also to their increased likelihood to live apart from their  children. Men contribute far less through child support (formal or informal) than they do when they  share their earnings within their household, suggesting that the destabilizing effects of incarceration  on family relationships place children at significant economic disadvantage.",2008-05,CRCW,WP08-09-FF.pdf,NULL,NULL,NULL,0

This body of research has primarily focused on the implications  of instability for children?s wellbeing, and has largely neglected how instability may  shape children?s home environments, especially early parenting behaviors. The lack of  research in this area is problematic because parenting has been found to be a key  predictor of children?s ability to successfully transition into school (Brooks-Gunn &  Markman, 2005; Hill, 2001). Additionally, while extensive attention has been given to  divorce as a source of instability, we know much less about the consequences and nature  of instability in nonmarital relationships.

A key result demonstrated is that how the economy responds to shocks, i.e. unexpected  changes in the drift and standard deviation of the stochastic process describing the dynamics  of productivity, depends on the power of labor to extract rents and on the status quo level  of firing costs. In particular, we show that when firing costs are relatively low to begin with,  a transition to a rigid labor market is favored by all and only the employed workers with  idiosyncratic productivity below some threshold value. A more volatile environment, and a  lower rate of productivity growth, i.e. ""bad times,"" increase the political support for more  labor market rigidity only where labor appropriates of relatively large rents. Moreover, we  demonstrate that when the status quo level of firing costs is relatively high, the preservation  of a rigid labor market is favored by the employed with intermediate productivity, whereas all  other workers favor more flexibility. The coming of better economic conditions need not favor  the demise of high firing costs in rigid high-rents economies, because ""good times"" cut down  the support for flexibility among the least productive employed workers. The model described  provides some new insights on the comparative dynamics of labor market institutions in the  U.S. and in Europe over the last few decades, shedding some new light both on the reasons for  the original build-up of ""Eurosclerosis,"" and for its the persistence up to the present day.",2008-05,RPPE,VindMay08.pdf,NULL,"D71, D72, E24, J41, J63, J65","employment protection, ?ring costs, productivity, political economy, rents,  volatility, growth, institutional divergence",0

The reduction in calorie  consumption cannot be attributed to declining real incomes, nor to any increase in the  relative price of food. Our leading hypothesis, on which much work remains to be done,  is that, as real incomes and wages have increased, leading to some nutritional improvement,  there has been an offsetting reduction in calorie requirements due to declining  levels of physical activity and possibly also to various improvements in the health  environment.

A mother's family structure whether she  is married, cohabiting or living without a partner may affect her employment through  her family's income needs, the instrumental and social support she receives, and her  perceived security to pursue her preferred level of employment. Additionally, if a woman  has a husband or cohabiting partner, she may take his preference for her employment  level into account. Alternatively, selection may explain the association between family  structure and maternal employment. In this analysis, I describe how the employment  of mothers varies by family structure in the five years after giving birth. Before taking  demographic or human capital characteristics into account, married, cohabiting and lone  mothers have similar levels of employment. Using covariate adjustments to account for  dierences in selection, I find that married mothers work less on average than unmarried  mothers, and that cohabiting and lone unmarried mothers have very similar employment  levels. Family income, family wealth, partner characteristics, and sex role attitudes  do not explain this marriage eect. I argue that married mothers work less because  they have greater perceived economic security, enabling them to pursue their preferred  level of employment when their children are very young. Black married mothers are  exceptional; on average, they work more than married white or Hispanic mothers and  have similar employment levels as black unmarried mothers.

First is the path dependency of market growth: without Viz?s  pioneering effort in the localization of manga in the 1980s, Tokyo pop?s standardization in the 2000s  would not have boosted the market expansion, and vice versa.

We hypothesize that the marriage ideal is determined by  the median income in an individual?s local reference group. After controlling flexibly for  the absolute level of income and a number of other factors, the ratio between a man?s  income and the marriage ideal is a strong predictor of marital status but only if he is  below the ideal.

In all of the scenarios that I consider, a substantial  portion of the intended transfer to low income single mothers is captured by employers  through reduced wages. The transfer to employers is borne in part by low skill workers  who are not themselves eligible for the EITC and are therefore made strictly worse off by  its existence. I contrast the EITC with a traditional Negative Income Tax (NIT). The  NIT discourages work, and so induces large transfers from employers of low skill labor to  their workers.

We define an extreme movement in stock prices as one that can be characterized as a three sigma event; that is, a daily movement in the broad stock-market index that is three or more standard deviations away from the average movement. We find that such extreme movements are typically preceded by, but not necessarily followed by, unusually large stock-price movements. Interestingly, a similar clustering of extreme observations of temperature in New York City can be observed.  A particularly robust finding in this paper is that extreme movements in stock prices are usually preceded by  larger than average daily movements during the preceding three-day period. This suggests that investors might fashion a market timing strategy, switching from stocks to cash in advance of predicted extreme negative stock returns. In fact, we have been able to simulate market timing strategies that are successful in avoiding nearly eighty percent of the negative extreme move days, yielding a significantly lower volatility of returns.

Licensing by multiple political jurisdictions is associated with the highest wage gains  relative to only local licensing. Specific requirements by the government for a worker to enter an  occupation, such as education level and long internships, are positively associated with wages.

Notice that offshorability is a characteristic of a person?s job, not of the person himself. We see this research as important for two main reasons.  First, one of us has argued previously that offshoring is potentially a very important labor market phenomenon in the United States and elsewhere, perhaps eventually amounting to a third Industrial Revolution. In the first Industrial Revolution, the share of the U.S. workforce engaged in agriculture declined by over 80 percentage points. In the second Industrial Revolution, which is still in progress, the share of American workers employed in manufacturing has declined by almost 25 percentage points so far, with most of the migration going to the service sector. The estimates presented here, like those of Blinder (2009b), suggest that the share of U.S. workers performing what Blinder (2006) called impersonal service jobs (defined precisely below) might shrink significantly while the share performing personal service jobs rises.  Second, while readers must judge for themselves, we deem the pilot study to have been successful by several criteria that we will explain later. So we hope our survey methods will be replicated, improved upon, and eventually incorporated into some regular government survey, such as the Current Population Survey (CPS).

Accounting for new imported varieties lowers the import price index for intermediate goods on average by an additional 4.7 percent per year relative to conventional gains through lower prices of existing imports. Moreover, we find that lower input tariffs account on average for 31 percent of the new products introduced by domestic firms, which implies potentially large dynamic gains from trade. This expansion in firms' product scope is driven to a large extent by international trade increasing access of firms to new input varieties rather than by simply making existing imported inputs cheaper.

I develop a rational choice model of voting in union representation elections (government supervised secret ballot elections, generally held at the workplace, on the question of whether the workers would like to be represented by a union).  These elections provide a particularly good laboratory to study voter behavior because many of the elections have sufficiently few eligible voters that individuals can have a substantial probability of being pivotal. I implement this model empirically using data on over 75,000 of these elections held from 1972-2009.  The results suggest that most individuals (over 80 percent) vote in these elections independent of consideration of the likelihood that they will be pivotal.  Among the remainder, it appears that 1) the likelihood of voting falls with election size, 2) the likelihood of voting increases with the expected closeness of the election outcome, and 3) the marginal eect of closeness on the likelihood off voting increases in magnitude with election size.

The  most recent round of the ICP was for 2005 with final results published in early 2008;  version 7.0 of the Penn World Table will soon incorporate these results. The 2005 ICP,  like earlier rounds, involved substantial revisions to previous data, most notably revising  downwards the size of the Chinese (40 percent smaller) and Indian (36 percent)  economies. We discuss the reasons for the revisions, and assess their plausibility. We  focus on four important areas: how to handle international differences in quality, the  treatment of urban and rural areas of large countries such as China, India, and Brazil, how  to estimate prices for government services, health, and education, and the effects of the  regional structure of the ICP. All of these affect the interpretation of previous data, as  well as the current revisions. We discuss previous revisions of the PWT, and their effects  on various kinds of econometric analysis.

The theoretical solutions of positing that individuals receive utility from the act of voting itself ""explains"" why individuals vote, but it leaves open the question of whether or not there is a significant margin of individuals who consider the effect of their vote on the outcome in deciding whether or not to vote.  I develop a rational choice model of voting in union representation elections (government supervised secret ballot elections, generally held at the workplace, on the question of whether the workers would like to be represented by a union.)  These elections provide a particularly good laboratory to study voter behavior because many of the elections have sufficiently few eligible voters that individuals can have a substantial probability of being pivotal.  I implement this model empirically using data on over 75,000 of these elections held from 1972-2009.  The results suggest that most individuals (over 80 percent) vote in these elections independent of consideration of the likehood that they will be pivotal.  Among the reminder, it appears the 1) the likelihood of voting falls with election size, 2) the likelihood of voting increases with the expected closeness of the election outcome, and 3) the marginal effect of closeness on the likehood of voting increases in magnitude with election size.  While the first two findings are consistant with the standard rational choice model, the third is not.  The results suggest that, while these individuals consider first-order variation in the probability that they will be pivotal, they do not carry out a complete calculation of the probability of being pivotal.",2009-10,CEPS,196farber.pdf,NULL,"H390, J080, J290, D270","Union elections, voting behavior, rational choice",0

The boom in house prices in the United States from 2000 through 2006 is a case in point. According to the Case-Shiller 20-city index, the inflation-adjusted price of a median-sized house in the United States doubled over the period 2000-2006. House prices rose far more than the underlying fundamental drivers of home prices such as family income and rents. The bursting of the bubble was followed by a sharp rise in foreclosures and massive declines in the value of mortgage-backed securities and a variety of derivatives tied to these securities. The collapse of these prices led to the weakening, and in some cases the collapse, of major financial institutions around the world and contributed to one of the most serious recessions in the United States in the entire post-World War II period. The housing bubble is the most recent example of the asset-price bubbles that have often afflicted capitalist economies. Sharp increases in asset prices have frequently led to crashes and subsequent sharp declines in economic activity. Many economists have argued, controversially, that central banks should adjust their policy instruments to account not only for their forecasts of future inflation and the gap between actual and potential output, but for asset prices as well.  This paper will address three topics. First, I will describe what economists mean when they use the term bubble, and I will contrast the behavioral-finance view of asset pricing with the efficient-market paradigm in an attempt to understand why bubbles might persist and why they may not be arbitraged away.  Second, I will review some major historical examples of asset-price bubbles as well as the (minority) view that they may not have been bubbles at all. I will also examine the corresponding changes in real economic activity that have followed the bursting of such bubbles.  Finally, I will examine the most hotly-debated aspect of any discussion of asset-price bubbles: what, if anything, should policy makers do about them? Should they react to sharp increases in asset prices that they deem to be unrelated to fundamentals? Should they take the view that they know more than the market does? Should they recognize that asset-price bubbles are a periodic flaw of capitalism and conduct their policies so as to temper any developing excesses? Or should they focus solely on their primary targets of inflation and real economic activity? In my discussion I will pay particular attention to bubbles that are associated with sharp increases in credit and leverage.",2010-01,CEPS,200malkiel.pdf,NULL,"D010, D400, E300, H300, G330","Asset prices, price bubbles, housing prices, housing bubble",0

First, we examine whether the healthier behaviors of Hispanic immigrant mothers extend to other foreign-born groups, including non-Hispanic immigrant mothers in the U.S. and white, South Asian, black African and Caribbean, and other (largely East Asian) immigrants in the U.K, including higher SES groups. Second, we consider not only the size of the paradox at the time of the child's birth, but also the degree of its persistence into early childhood. Third, we examine whether nativity disparities are weaker in the U.K., where a much stronger welfare state makes health information and care more readily accessible. Finally, we examine whether differences in mothers? instrumental and social support both inside and out of the home can explain healthier behaviors among the foreign-born. The results suggest that healthier behaviors among immigrants are not limited to Hispanics or to low SES groups; that nativity differences are fairly persistent over time; that the immigrant advantage is equally strong in both countries; and that the composition and strength of mothers? support plays a trivial explanatory role in both countries.

There is skepticism about the ability of  econometric analysis to resolve these issues, or of development agencies to learn from  their own experience. In response, there is increasing use in development economics of  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to accumulate credible knowledge of what works,  without over-reliance on questionable theory or statistical methods. When RCTs are not  possible, the proponents of these methods advocate quasi-randomization through  instrumental variable (IV) techniques or natural experiments. I argue that many of these  applications are unlikely to recover quantities that are useful for policy or understanding:  two key issues are the misunderstanding of exogeneity, and the handling of  heterogeneity. I illustrate from the literature on aid and growth. Actual randomization  faces similar problems as does quasi-randomization, notwithstanding rhetoric to the  contrary. I argue that experiments have no special ability to produce more credible  knowledge than other methods, and that actual experiments are frequently subject to  practical problems that undermine any claims to statistical or epistemic superiority.

We organize our discussion of these various research designs by how they secure internal  validity: in this view, the RD design can been seen as a close cousin of the randomized experiment. An  important distinction which emerges from our discussion of heterogeneous treatment effects is between  ex post (descriptive) and ex ante (predictive) evaluations; these two types of evaluations have distinct, but  complementary goals. A second important distinction we make is between statistical statements that are descriptions of our knowledge of the program assignment process and statistical statements that are structural assumptions about individual behavior. Using these distinctions, we examine some commonly employed evaluation strategies, and assess them with a common set of criteria for internal validity, the foremost goal of an ex post evaluation. In some cases, we also provide some concrete illustrations of how internally valid causal estimates can be supplemented with specific structural assumptions to address external validity: the estimate from an internally valid ""experimental"" estimate can be viewed as a leading term in an extrapolation for a parameter of interest in an ex ante evaluation.",2010-04,IRS,dsp01ms35t863r,NULL,"C010, C400, C350","Regression Discontinuity Design, program evaluation, heterogeneous treatment effects",0

Because the sending countries are generally poor, many Americans believe that the immigrants themselves are uniformly poor and uneducated. Their move is commonly portrayed as a one-way escape from hunger, want, and persecution and their arrival on U.S. shores as not too different from that of the tired, ""huddled masses"" that Emma Lazarus immortalized at the base of the Statue of Liberty.

Using U.S. data, we examine both donations of money and time, and find that engaging in charitable behavior when young is a strong predictor of adult altruistic behavior, ceteris paribus. A major issue in the interpretation of this result is that the correlation between youthful and adult altruistic behavior may be due to some third variable that affects both. While it is impossible to rule out such a possibility, we are able to control for family influences that likely could affect lifetime attitudes toward altruism.

A negative binomial model explores the effect of 1) early socialization in the arts and family background 2) education 3) differential involvement by gender in the labor force; and 4) the influence of marriage, on women?s and men?s cultural participation. A disaggregated analysis by age groups indicates that early socialization in the arts completely accounts for women?s higher cultural consumption in younger age groups and that education increases men?s participation in the arts more than women?s for oldest respondents. These findings do not support the idea that the gendered division of labor on highbrow culture has disappeared for younger respondents, but delineate instead how gendered patterns of participation in the arts are mediated by broad transformations in the educational regime in the United States.",2010-11,CACPS,WP42-Christin.pdf,NULL,"D010, J160, L820, Z110","Survey of Public Participation in the Arts, gender, cultural choice, participation in high-status cultural activities, women, men",0

First, when these large individual-level effects are combined with massive increases and racial disparity in the risk of parental imprisonment, it becomes transparent that the prison boom has been a key driver of the dramatic increases in the risk of homelessness for black children. Thus, while economic downturns bring to mind the effects of foreclosure and eviction on homelessness, mass imprisonment may have played a role in the growth of the population of homeless African American children even during the economic boom of the late 1990s.

An in?nitely lived agent chooses  each period between two alternatives with unknown types, to maximize discounted  payo�s. The agent can experiment with each alternative and receive payo�s that are  partially informative about its type. The agent does not recall past actions or payo�s.  Instead, the agent has a ?nite number of memory states as in Wilson (2004): he can  condition his actions only on the memory state he is currently in, and he can update  his memory state depending on the payo� received.  I ?nd that the inclination to choose the currently better alternative does not con-  strain learning in the limit as discounting vanishes. Even though uncertainties are  independent, the agent optimally holds correlated beliefs across memory states. Op-  timally, memory states re?ect the magnitude of the relative ranking of alternatives.  After a high payo� from one of the alternatives, the agent optimally moves to a mem-  ory state with more pessimistic beliefs on the other, even though no information about  the latter alternative is received. For the case where one alternative is substantially  more informative than the other, he chooses the latter only for myopic exploitation  purposes, and ignores any information about it, suggesting specialization in learning.  For the special case with one known (safe) alternative, a su� ciently patient agent  never ceases experimentation and tries the unknown alternative at least occasionally  after any history.

We also estimate the return to college selectivity for the 1976 cohort of students, but over a longer time horizon (from 1983 through 2007) using administrative data.  We find that the return to college selectivity is sizeable for both cohorts in regression models that control for variables commonly observed by researchers, such as student high school GPA and SAT scores. However, when we adjust for unobserved student ability by controlling for the average SAT score of the colleges that students applied to, our estimates of the return to college selectivity fall substantially and are generally indistinguishable from zero. There were notable exceptions for certain subgroups. For black and Hispanic students and for students who come from less-educated families (in terms of their parents? education), the estimates of the return to college selectivity remain large, even in models that adjust for unobserved student characteristics.",2011-02,IRS,dsp01gf06g265z,NULL,"D190, I210, I280, J240","college admissions, future income, SAT, GPA",0

In 2008, 45 percent of British children were born outside of marriage, up from 8 percent in 1971. A similar trend appears in the US, with 41 percent of births in 2008 occurring to unmarried mothers, up from 11 percent in 1971. Whereas a great deal has been written about the causes of these trends, surprisingly little is known about the conditions and experiences of the parents and children in these families. In this paper we compare and contrast families formed by married and unmarried parents during the first five years after child?s birth. An emerging body of research indicates that children?s experiences in infancy and early childhood have lasting consequences for their future health and development (Shonkoff and Phillips 2000); a second literature indicates that parental resources and partnerships play a large role in shaping children?s early experiences (Duncan and Magnuson 2005). Together, these two bodies of research suggest that in order to understand the long-run implications of the increase in non-marital childbearing for parents, children and society, we must understand how the parents and children in these families are doing during the first five years after birth.  This paper compares and contrasts families formed by unmarried parents in the UK and the UK by addressing several questions:  What is the nature of parental relationships and what are parents? characteristics and capabilities at the time their child is born?  What happens to parental relationships over time?  What happens to mothers? economic and psychological resources; What happens to non-resident fathers? contributions over time?  How do children fare, and how do family structure and stability influence the quality of mothers? parenting and children?s wellbeing?  To answer these questions, we rely on data from two birth cohort studies that follow children from the time they are born to the time they enter kindergarten: the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), which has been following approximately 18,800 children born in the UK at the turn of the twenty first century, and the Fragile Families Study (FFS), which has being following approximately 5,000 children born in US cities between 1998 and 2000. Both of these studies contain rich information about the quality and stability of parental relationships, and both studies contain extensive information on parental resources parental behavior and children?s wellbeing. Both studies also oversample for disadvantaged families. Given their overlap in questions and measures and their similarity in samples, these two data sets are ideal for comparing families formed by unmarried couples in the two countries. More detailed information about these two studies can be found for the MCS in Hansen et al. (2008) and for the FFS in Reichman et al.

The view is that firms in high cost production locations that do not innovate are faced with loss of market share from import competition, so jobs move to producers in developing countries with lower labour costs. Domestic firms are encouraged to innovate, and to obtain intellectual property assets to protect their innovations, so that they can sustain local employment and pay high wages. Policies to subsidise R&D and to encourage intellectual property protection are partly justified on these grounds. Nevertheless the available evidence concerning the employment and wage benefits of such activity is rather sparse.  In this paper we first survey some existing literature on innovation and jobs. We outline arguments for using both patents and trade marks as indicators of innovation. We then construct a large sample of UK firms observed from 2000 to 2006, matching records of patents and trade marks to company data. We begin by estimating a cross section employment growth equation for 2003-2006 to discover if there is any impact of stocks of trade marks acquired in 2000-2003. We then explore in more detail the impact of recent trade mark and patenting activity on the level of employment and the average rate of pay in these firms. We do this using the data as a six year panel, estimating both an employment function and a relative earnings equation at the firm level.

Spain represents an interesting case study for this analysis because all levels of public administration in this country have systematically used migrant associations as the key actor in defining or implementing integration policies and have cited co-development as an important objective of their policies, linked to immigration control and regulation. Even though our empirical analysis is limited by the small n used (29 cases), our preliminary suggestion is that certain features of an association increase both the percentage of its budget derived from government funding, as well as the likelihood that it has contacts with local, regional or national authorities in the country of origin.

This episode is an excellent example of a dominant type of transnational activity in which Colombian organizations in the U.S. are involved. In 1999, after an earthquake hit the coffee-producing region, immigrant organizations were created, others were revived, and all rushed in to assist their compatriots; this time, without the president?s call for assistance. While this type of assistance might be common, the convergence of projects on single regions or coordination with state and international relief institutions is not. Aside from these moments of national solidarity, Colombian organizations decide about the projects they want to develop on their own, choose the project and the places to carry them out according to their own preferences and personal contacts, establish their own connections in Colombia, and resort to their own means in order to monitor the completion of their projects.  How can we explain this type of involvement of Colombian immigrant organizations in their home-country?

The choice of these two groups was driven by the intent to compare a long standing immigrant population with a recent one to check whether migratory historicity might have influenced the shaping of respective associational fields. The difference of ethnicities (Asian non Christian vs European Christian) was another aspect which influenced this choice: the race relation policy primarily targeted Black and Ethnic Minorities (BME) and therefore left aside white populations such as the Poles. Interestingly, the comparison between the two populations turned out to be very relevant but not for the expected reasons. In fact the Polish associational field we discovered has even older roots than the Indian one: it was basically established during the immediate post-war period.

The empirical work is based upon a rich set of micro data on alumni giving at an anonymous research university, which we call Anon U.

A novel aspect of our modeling strategy is that, consistent with the view of some professional fundraisers, we allow the receipt of a given form of aid per se to affect alumni giving. At the same time, our model allows the amount of the support to affect giving behavior nonlinearly.  Our main findings are: 1) Individuals who took out student loans are less likely to make a gift, other things being the same. Further, individuals who take out large loans make smaller con-tributions as alumni, conditional on making a gift. This effect is unlikely to be due to the fact that repaying the loan reduces the alumnus?s capacity to give. We conjecture that, rather, it is caused by an ?annoyance effect? ? alumni resent the fact that they are burdened with loans. 2) Scholar-ship aid reduces the size of a gift, conditional on making a gift, but has little effect on the proba-bility of making a donation. Students who received scholarships are also less likely to be in the top 10 percent of givers in their class in a given year. The negative effect of receiving a scholar-ship on the amount donated decreases in absolute value with the size of the scholarship.

The empirical analyses use data from three nationally representative surveys, providing access to numerous measures of family well-being. In addition, we attempt to handle the possibility of non-random selection into subsidy receipt by using several identification strategies both within and across the surveys. Our results consistently indicate that child care subsidies are associated with worse maternal health and poorer interactions between parents and their children. In particular, subsidized mothers report lower levels of overall health and are more likely to show symptoms consistent with anxiety, depression, and parenting stress. Such mothers also reveal more psychological and physical aggression toward their children and are more likely to utilize spanking as a disciplinary tool. Together, these findings suggest that work-based public policies aimed at economically disadvantaged mothers may ultimately undermine family well-being.",2012-01,CRCW,WP11-20-FF.pdf,NULL,"D600, I000, I380, J130","child care, subsidy, employment, Child Care and Development Fund, families, mothers",0

The empirical analyses use data from three nationally representative surveys, providing access to numerous measures of family well-being. In addition, we attempt to handle the possibility of non-random selection into subsidy receipt by using several identification strategies both within and across the surveys. Our results consistently indicate that child care subsidies are associated with worse maternal health and poorer interactions between parents and their children. In particular, subsidized mothers report lower levels of overall health and are more likely to show symptoms consistent with anxiety, depression, and parenting stress. Such mothers also reveal more psychological and physical aggression toward their children and are more likely to utilize spanking as a disciplinary tool.

The more salient a tax is, the more taxpayers adjust their demand in response to  changes in the taxed good's after-tax price. If tax salience affects behavior, a natural question follows:  How salient should a government's revenue collection system be? I investigate this question by considering  the problem faced by a benevolent government choosing between high- and low-salience commodity taxes  to meet a revenue constraint. I show that low-salience taxes introduce two offsetting welfare effects:  on the one hand, they reduce the excess burden traditionally associated with distortionary taxation by  dampening consumers' substitution away from the taxed good; on the other hand, low-salience taxes  introduce new welfare costs by causing consumers to make optimization errors when deciding how much  of each good to purchase. Under certain conditions, I show that governments can utilize a combination of  high- and low-salience commodity taxes to achieve the first-best welfare outcome, even without employing  a lump-sum tax. I also derive a simple and intuitive formula that characterizes the optimal mix between  high- and low-salience taxes needed to obtain this outcome. Under the optimal policy, the low-salience  tax is strictly non-zero, and the ratio of low- to high-salience taxes is 1) increasing in the compensated  own-price elasticity of demand for the taxed good, 2) decreasing in the income-sensitivity of the taxed  good, and 3) decreasing in the taxed good's share of the budget.

Evidence based approaches that promote greater use of Rigorous Impact Evaluations (including randomized control trials) and evidence from those evaluations in policy and programming have added more rigor to the E (evaluation) in traditional M&E. Here we extend the basic idea of rigorous impact evaluation?the use of a valid counter-factual to make judgments about causality to evaluate project design and implementation. This adds a new learning component of experiential learning or a little e to the M&RIE so that instead of just M&E development projects are all about MeE. Structured experiential learning allows implementing agencies to actively and rigorously search across alternative project designs using the monitoring data that provides real time performance information with direct feedback into project design and implementation.

Critics of the proposal have argued that high-income taxpayers would receive a tax cut, and given that the proposal is meant to be revenue neutral, this would inevitably lead to increased taxes for families with low and moderate incomes. Because the Romney proposal does not specify in detail just what tax preferences might be eliminated or scaled back in order to broaden the tax base, much of the debate over it has focused on what provisions would be politically and administratively feasible.  While this discussion has been illuminating in some respects, something seems to be missing. Relatively little has been said about the possible effects of the Romney proposal on economic growth. This is curious because increasing growth is the motivation for the proposal in the first place.  In this paper, I analyze the Romney proposal taking into account the additional income that might be generated by economic growth. The main conclusion is that under plausible assumptions, a proposal along the lines suggested by Governor Romney can both be revenue neutral and keep the net tax burden on high-income individuals about the same. That is, an increase in the tax burden on lower and middle income individuals is not required in order to make the overall plan revenue neutral.",2012-09,CEPS,228rosen.pdf,NULL,"D310, D190, E620, H200, H210","tax reform, income tax rates, tax cut",0

More specifically, we find that the introduction of a new production technology  spurred productivity growth through two channels. First, the entry of minimills lead to  a slow but steady drop in the market share of the incumbent technology, the vertically  integrated producers. Second, while the new technology started out with a significant  productivity premium, by the end of the sample minimills and vertically integrated  producers are very similar in terms of efficiency.

We develop a framework to estimate markups from production data with mult-product firms.  This apporoach does not require assumptions on the market structure or demand curves faced by the firms, nor assumptions on how firms allocate their inputs across products.  We exploit quantity and price information to disentangle markups from quantity-based productivity, and then compute marginal costs by dividing observed prices by the estimated markups.  We use India's trade liberalization episode to examine how firms adjust these performance measures.  Not surprisingly, we find that trade liberalization lowers factory-gate prices and that output tariff declines have the expected pro-competitive effects.  However, the price declines are small relative to the declines in marginal costs, which fall predominantly because of input tariff liberalization.  The reason is that firms offset their reductions in marginal costs by raising markups.  Our results demonstrate substantial heterogeneity and variability in markups across firms and time and suggest that producers benefited relative to consumers, at least immediately after the reforms.  Long-term gains to consumers may be higher to the extent that higher firm profits lead to new product introductions and growth.  Indeed, firms with larger increases in markups had a higher propensity to introduce new products during this period.",2012-09,CEPS,231deloecker.pdf,NULL,"D210, D400, F100, F120, F400","markups, productivity, pass-through, input tariffs, trade liberalization",0

In this paper, we  report the results from a laboratory experiment designed explicitly to study the dynamics  of free riding behavior in the accumulation of a durable public good that provides a stream  of discounted benefits over a potentially infinite horizon. This dynamic free-rider problem  differs from static ones in fundamental ways and implies several economically important  predictions that are absent in static frameworks. We consider two cases: economies with  reversibility (RIE), where the agents? voluntary contributions to the public good can be  positive or negative; and economies with irreversibility (IIE), where contributions are non  negative. For both economies, we characterize the unique Markov perfect equilibrium. The  evidence supports the main predictions from the theory: behavior is generally consistent  with stationary, forward-looking behavior; both in RIE and IIE the accumulation path is  inefficiently slow and the public good under-provided; and RIE induces significantly higher  public good contributions than IIE. A number of interesting deviations from the theoretical  predictions are observed: both in RIE and in IIE we have over-investment in the early rounds  of the game; in RIE over-investment is followed by periods in which negative contributions  correct the stock, bringing it back to the predicted steady state; in IIE over-investment tends  to decline approaching zero. To test the Markovian assumption, we compare the predictions  of the Markov equilibrium with the prediction of the most efficient subgame perfect equilibrium  and propose a novel experimental methodology that relies on the comparison between  the behavior in the dynamic game and the behavior in a one-period reduced-form version of  the dynamic game.",2012-10,ET,wp048_2012_Battaglini_Nunnari_Palfrey_Dyn_Free_Rider.pdf,NULL,"C72, C73, C78, C92, H41","Durable Public Goods, Voluntary Contribution Mechanism, Experiments",0

The data set contains the 18-question food security module which allows us to explore the link between incarceration and food insecurity and very low food security among children, families, and adults. The incidence of very low food security in our data is somewhat higher than the national average, but the incidence of other levels of food security is similar to national aggregates.  Since there is likely reverse causality in the relationship between parental incarceration and food insecurity, we employ a variety of program evaluation techniques to identify the causal relationship between food insecurity and parental incarceration. We employ imputation techniques to account for non-response among the food security variables and independent variables.  Our ordinary least squares results suggest that having at least one parent that has ever been incarcerated has a small positive effect (1 to 4 percentage points) on the probability of very low food security among children, adults and households with children, but the results are not significant in various specification. Food insecurity for adults and households with children (a less dire level of food insecurity than very low food security) is affected by parental incarceration under most specifications with magnitudes of impact from 4 to 15 percentage points.

However, little is  known about their efficacy. In this paper, we evaluate a DV program using a panel of health plan  enrollment data from a large, single-site employer who implemented it several years ago. We  find that relative to all other years, dependents were 2.7 percentage points less likely to be  reenrolled in the year that DV was introduced, indicating that this fraction of dependents was  ineligibly enrolled prior to the program?s introduction. These disenrollment effects were  especially large for same-sex partners and older children. We show that the program did not  induce employees to leave the employer?s plan and (say) put themselves and their dependents on  the spouse?s plan. We also show that disenrollment occurred because dependents were actually  ineligible, not because of compliance costs that might be associated with providing  documentation. The DV program saved about $46 per enrolled employee. A considerable  fraction of these cost savings came from removing older children who didn?t meet additional  criteria. Therefore, the dependent coverage provision of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, which  essentially renders all children up to age 26 eligible in all employer health plans, will  substantially limit the future cost saving potential of such programs. Hence, as the state  governments and private employers that have implemented DV programs adapt to the new  regulatory environment, the popularity of dependent verification programs may well diminish.",2013-04,CEPS,232rosen.pdf,NULL,"D190, H310, I110, I000, J320","health insurance, dependents, benefits, costs, verification, health care",0

Our main finding is that taking into account the approach of death substantially changes the age-giving profile for the elderly?in one segment of the age distribution, the independent effect of an increase in age on giving actually changes from negative to positive.  We examine how the decline in giving as death approaches varies with the length of time that a given condition is likely to bring about death, and the individual?s age when he died. We find that for individuals who died from conditions that bring about death fairly quickly, there is little decline in giving as death approaches compared to those who died from other causes. Further, the decline in giving as death approaches is steeper for the elderly (for whom death is less likely to be a surprise) than for the relatively young. These findings suggest that our primary result, that failing to take into account the approach of death leads to biased inferences with respect to the age-giving profile, is not merely an artifact of some kind of nonlinearity in the relationship  between age and giving.",2013-06,CEPS,236rosen.pdf,NULL,"D64, I23, J14, H41","charitable giving, aging, financing of higher education, philanthropy, terror management theory",0

There is  little empirical research on what constitutes an optimal patent term, or whether  patent term should vary across industry categories.  We take a rst step in studying these issues by examining cross-industry  differences in patent term sensitivity. We take advantage of a change in law   the passage of the TRIPS agreement in 1994  that caused patent term to be  measured from the date a patent application was led rather than the date the  patent was granted, thereby reducing patent term by the amount of time an  application was pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Using  a new dataset, we determine what portion of this delay is attributable to the  applicant for 307,597 issued patents led in 1994-1996. This shows, for thefi rst  time, how patent applicants in different industries sped up their prosecution  behavior in response to the change in law, which gives us a measure of industry  sensitivity to patent term change.  We predict, via a formal model, that patent applicants in industries with  higher profits toward the end of patent term are the applicants most likely to  speed up patent prosecution after TRIPS. Our results show that pharmaceuticals  patentees sped up patent prosecution signicantly, which accords with prior theory  on the primacy of patents in this industry. We find, however, that software  patentees also significantly sped up prosecution, which is unexpected given prior  theory suggesting patents are less important in spurring software development.  Additionally, our paper exploits another, separate aspect of the legal change  that gave some firms longer patent term extensions vis a vis others. We perform  an event study and find thatfirms receiving longer extensions tended to have  higher market returns. We obtain similar results using a new empirical technique  known as regression kink design, which addresses potential selection issues.  Finally, we test for and find a high degree of correlation between our two  new measures of patent term sensitivity.
